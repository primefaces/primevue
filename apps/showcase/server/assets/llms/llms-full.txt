# Introduction

Next-generation UI Component suite for Vue.

## Accessibility

PrimeVue has WCAG 2.1 AA level compliance; each component has a dedicated accessibility section to document several aspects, including keyboard and screen reader support. Through communication channels such as GitHub or Discord, numerous accessibility experts worldwide continue to provide constant feedback to improve the accessibility features further. View the accessibility guide to learn more.

## Add Ons

PrimeVue does not require financial sponsorships from its community; instead, to be backed by a solid financial foundation, optional add-ons are offered. These include a Figma UI Kit, premium application templates, and reusable UI blocks called PrimeBlocks. The add-ons are optional and there is no paywall when using PrimeVue.

## Overview

PrimeVue is a complete UI suite for Vue.js consisting of a rich set of UI components, icons, blocks, and application templates. The project's primary goal is to boost developer productivity by offering reusable solutions that are easy to tune and customize as an in-house library. The project has been created by PrimeTek a world-renowned vendor of popular UI Component suites, including PrimeFaces , PrimeNG , and PrimeReact. All the members in our team are full time employees of PrimeTek who share the same passion and vision for open source to create awesome UI libraries. Depending on a 3rd party library may introduce risks if the library maintainers decide not to work on the project, however, this is not the case with PrimeVue as the track record of PrimeTek shows. For example, PrimeFaces has been maintained actively since 2008.

## Pass Through

PassThrough is an innovative API to provide access to the internal DOM elements to add arbitrary attributes. In general, traditional UI component libraries encapsulate UI and logic with limited APIs that makes the developers dependant on the library maintainer to extend this API by adding new props or events. With Pass Through this limitation has been eliminated since, you'll be able to access the internal of the components to add events and attributes. Some common use-cases are adding test attributes, additional aria attributes, custom events and styling.

## Theming

PrimeVue can be styled in two modes; styled or unstyled. Styled mode is based on pre-skinned components with opinionated theme variants of PrimeOne design like Aura, Lara or Nora presets. Unstyled mode on the other hand, leaves the styling to you while implementing the functionality and accessibility. Unstyled mode provides full control over the styling with no boundaries by implementing a pluggable architecture to utilize CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma or your own custom CSS. We've even further built the Volt UI library that styles the components with utility classes of Tailwind. This design is future proof as PrimeVue can be styled with any CSS library without actually depending on it in its core.

# Configuration

Application wide configuration for PrimeVue.

## Import

Configuration is managed by the PrimeVue instance imported from primevue/config .

```vue
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, { /* options */ });
```

## InputVariant

Input fields come in two styles, default is outlined with borders around the field whereas filled alternative adds a background color to the field. Applying p-variant-filled to an ancestor of an input enables the filled style. If you prefer to use filled inputs in the entire application, use a global container such as the document body or the application element to apply the style class. Note that in case you add it to the application element, components that are teleported to the document body such as Dialog will not be able to display filled inputs as they are not a descendant of the application root element in the DOM tree, to resolve this case set inputVariant to filled at PrimeVue configuration as well.

```vue
import {createApp} from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, { inputVariant: "filled" });
```

## Pass Through

Defines the shared pass through properties per component type. Visit the Pass Through Props documentation for more information.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    pt: {
        slider: {
            handle: { class: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast' }
        }
    }
});
```

## Pass Through Options

Used to configure the ptOptions properties of components and the usePassThrough method. The mergeSections defines whether the sections from the main configuration gets added and the mergeProps controls whether to override or merge the defined props. Defaults are true for mergeSections and false for mergeProps .

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    ptOptions: {
        mergeSections: true,
        mergeProps: false
    }
});
```

## Ripple

Ripple is an optional animation for the supported components such as buttons. It is disabled by default and needs to be enabled at your app's entry file (e.g. main.js) during the PrimeVue setup.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, { ripple: true });
```

## Theme

Style mode offers theming based on a design token based architecture. See the styled mode documentation for details such as building your own theme.

```vue
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    theme: {
        preset: Aura,
        options: {
            prefix: 'p',
            darkModeSelector: 'system',
            cssLayer: false
        }
    }
 });
```

## Unstyled

Unstyled mode instructs the components not to add any built-in style classes so that they can be styled using custom css or libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Visit Unstyled mode documentation for more information.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, { unstyled: true });
```

## ZIndex

ZIndexes are managed automatically to make sure layering of overlay components work seamlessly when combining multiple components. Still there may be cases where you'd like to configure the configure default values such as a custom layout where header section is fixed. In a case like this, dropdown needs to be displayed below the application header but a modal dialog should be displayed above. PrimeVue configuration offers the zIndex property to customize the default values for components categories. Default values are described below and can be customized when setting up PrimeVue.

```vue
import {createApp} from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    zIndex: {
        modal: 1100,        //dialog, drawer
        overlay: 1000,      //select, popover
        menu: 1000,         //overlay menus
        tooltip: 1100       //tooltip
    }
});
```

## Nonce

The nonce value to use on dynamically generated style elements in core.

## Import

Locale values are stored in the global configuration that becomes accessible after installing the PrimeVue.

```vue
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue);
```

## Locale Api

Configuration is managed by the Locale API imported from primevue/config . Locale Options Key Value startsWith Starts with contains Contains notContains Not contains endsWith Ends with equals Equals notEquals Not equals noFilter No Filter lt Less than lte Less than or equal to gt Greater than gte Greater than or equal to dateIs Date is dateIsNot Date is not dateBefore Date is before dateAfter Date is after clear Clear apply Apply matchAll Match All matchAny Match Any addRule Add Rule removeRule Remove Rule accept Yes reject No choose Choose upload Upload cancel Cancel completed Completed pending Pending fileSizeTypes ['B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'PB', 'EB', 'ZB', 'YB'] dayNames ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday' dayNamesShort ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat' dayNamesMin ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa' monthNames ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December' monthNamesShort ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec' chooseYear Choose Year chooseMonth Choose Month chooseDate Choose Date prevDecade Previous Decade nextDecade Next Decade prevYear Previous Year nextYear Next Year prevMonth Previous Month nextMonth Next Month prevHour Previous Hour nextHour Next Hour prevMinute Previous Minute nextMinute Next Minute prevSecond Previous Second nextSecond Next Second am am pm pm today Today weekHeader Wk firstDayOfWeek 0 showMonthAfterYear false dateFormat mm/dd/yy weak Weak medium Medium strong Strong passwordPrompt Enter a password searchMessage {0} results are available selectionMessage {0} items selected emptySelectionMessage No selected item emptySearchMessage No results found fileChosenMessage {0} files noFileChosenMessage No file chosen emptyMessage No available options aria.trueLabel True aria.falseLabel False aria.nullLabel Not Selected aria.star 1 star aria.stars {star} stars aria.selectAll All items selected aria.unselectAll All items unselected aria.close Close aria.previous Previous aria.next Next aria.navigation Navigation aria.scrollTop Scroll Top aria.moveTop Move Top aria.moveUp Move Up aria.moveDown Move Down aria.moveBottom Move Bottom aria.moveToTarget Move to Target aria.moveToSource Move to Source aria.moveAllToTarget Move All to Target aria.moveAllToSource Move All to Source aria.pageLabel Page {page} aria.firstPageLabel First Page aria.lastPageLabel Last Page aria.nextPageLabel Next Page aria.prevPageLabel Previous Page aria.rowsPerPageLabel Rows per page aria.jumpToPageDropdownLabel Jump to Page Dropdown aria.jumpToPageInputLabel Jump to Page Input aria.selectRow Row Selected aria.unselectRow Row Unselected aria.expandRow Row Expanded aria.collapseRow Row Collapsed aria.showFilterMenu Show Filter Menu aria.hideFilterMenu Hide Filter Menu aria.filterOperator Filter Operator aria.filterConstraint Filter Constraint aria.editRow Row Edit aria.saveEdit Save Edit aria.cancelEdit Cancel Edit aria.listView List View aria.gridView Grid View aria.slide Slide aria.slideNumber {slideNumber} aria.zoomImage Zoom Image aria.zoomIn Zoom In aria.zoomOut Zoom Out aria.rotateRight Rotate Right aria.rotateLeft Rotate Left

## Repository

Ready to use settings for locales are available at the community supported PrimeLocale repository. We'd appreciate if you could contribute to this repository with pull requests and share it with the rest of the community.

## Set Locale

Second parameter of the use function can be used to initiate the locale during PrimeVue installation. The locale configuration is reactive so that any changes are instantly reflected in the UI. Suppose you are doing a multi language application and need to change the language dynamically.

# Styled Mode

Choose from a variety of pre-styled themes or develop your own.

## Architecture

PrimeVue is a design agnostic library so unlike some other UI libraries it does not enforce a certain styling such as material design. Styling is decoupled from the components using the themes instead. A theme consists of two parts; base and preset . The base is the style rules with CSS variables as placeholders whereas the preset is a set of design tokens to feed a base by mapping the tokens to CSS variables. A base may be configured with different presets, currently Aura, Material, Lara and Nora are the available built-in options. The core of the styled mode architecture is based on a concept named design token , a preset defines the token configuration in 3 tiers; primitive , semantic and component . Primitive Tokens Primitive tokens have no context, a color palette is a good example for a primitive token such as blue-50 to blue-900 . A token named blue-500 may be used as the primary color, the background of a message however on its own, the name of the token does not indicate context. Usually they are utilized by the semantic tokens. Semantic Tokens Semantic tokens define content and their names indicate where they are utilized, a well known example of a semantic token is the primary.color . Semantic tokens map to primitive tokens or other semantic tokens. The colorScheme token group is a special variable to define tokens based on the color scheme active in the application, this allows defining different tokens based on the color scheme like dark mode. Component Tokens Component tokens are isolated tokens per component such as inputtext.background or button.color that map to the semantic tokens. As an example, button.background component token maps to the primary.color semantic token which maps to the green.500 primitive token. Best Practices Use primitive tokens when defining the core color palette and semantic tokens to specify the common design elements such as focus ring, primary colors and surfaces. Components tokens should only be used when customizing a specific component. By defining your own design tokens as a custom preset, you'll be able to define your own style without touching CSS. Overriding the PrimeVue components using style classes is not a best practice and should be the last resort, design tokens are the suggested approach. Video Tutorial Watch the PrimeVue Theming Demystified series to learn more about the architecture with examples.

## C S S Modules

CSS modules are supported by enabling the module property on a style element within your SFC. Use the $style keyword to apply classes to a PrimeVue component. It is recommend to enable cssLayer when using CSS modules so that the PrimeVue styles have low CSS specificity.

## Colors

Color palette of a preset is defined by the primitive design token group. You can access colors using CSS variables or the $dt utility.

## Dark Mode

PrimeVue uses the system as the default darkModeSelector in theme configuration. If you have a dark mode switch in your application, set the darkModeSelector to the selector you utilize such as .my-app-dark so that PrimeVue can fit in seamlessly with your color scheme. Following is a very basic example implementation of a dark mode switch, you may extend it further by involving prefers-color-scheme to retrieve it from the system initially and use localStorage to make it stateful. See this article for more information. In case you prefer to use dark mode all the time, apply the darkModeSelector initially and never change it. It is also possible to disable dark mode completely using false or none as the value of the selector.

## Presets

Aura, Material, Lara and Nora are the available built-in options, created to demonstrate the power of the design-agnostic theming. Aura is PrimeTek's own vision, Material follows Google Material Design v2, Lara is based on Bootstrap and Nora is inspired by enterprise applications. Visit the source code to learn more about the structure of presets. You may use them out of the box with modifications or utilize them as reference in case you need to build your own presets from scratch.

## Reserved Keys

Following keys are reserved in the preset scheme and cannot be used as a token name; primitive , semantic , components , directives , colorscheme , light , dark , common , root , states , and extend .

## Scale

PrimeVue UI component use rem units, 1rem equals to the font size of the html element which is 16px by default. Use the root font-size to adjust the size of the components globally. This website uses 14px as the base so it may differ from your application if your base font size is different.

```vue
html {
    font-size: 14px;
}
```

## Scoped Tokens

Design tokens can be scoped to a certain component using the dt property. In this example, first switch uses the global tokens whereas second one overrides the global with its own tokens. This approach is recommended over the :deep() as it offers a cleaner API while avoiding the hassle of CSS rule overrides.

## Options

The options property defines the how the CSS would be generated from the design tokens of the preset. prefix The prefix of the CSS variables, defaults to p . For instance, the primary.color design token would be var(--p-primary-color) . darkModeSelector The CSS rule to encapsulate the CSS variables of the dark mode, the default is the system to generate @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) . If you need to make the dark mode toggleable based on the user selection define a class selector such as .app-dark and toggle this class at the document root. See the dark mode toggle section for an example. cssLayer Defines whether the styles should be defined inside a CSS layer by default or not. A CSS layer would be handy to declare a custom cascade layer for easier customization if necessary. The default is false .

## Theme

The theme property is used to customize the initial theme.

```vue
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    // Default theme configuration
    theme: {
        preset: Aura,
        options: {
            prefix: 'p',
            darkModeSelector: 'system',
            cssLayer: false
        }
    }
 });
```

## Libraries

Example layer configuration for the popular CSS libraries.

## Reset

In case PrimeVue components have visual issues in your application, a Reset CSS may be the culprit. CSS layers would be an efficient solution that involves enabling the PrimeVue layer, wrapping the Reset CSS in another layer and defining the layer order. This way, your Reset CSS does not get in the way of PrimeVue components.

```vue
/* Order */
@layer reset, primevue;

/* Reset CSS */
@layer reset {
    button,
    input {
        /* CSS to Reset */
    }
}
```

## Specificity

The &#64;layer is a standard CSS feature to define cascade layers for a customizable order of precedence. If you need to become more familiar with layers, visit the documentation at MDN to begin with. The cssLayer is disabled by default, when it is enabled at theme configuration, PrimeVue wraps the built-in style classes under the primevue cascade layer to make the library styles easy to override. CSS in your app without a layer has the highest CSS specificity, so you'll be able to override styles regardless of the location or how strong a class is written. Layers also make it easier to use CSS Modules, view the CSS Modules guide for examples.

## Color Scheme

A token can be defined per color scheme using light and dark properties of the colorScheme property. Each token can have specific values based on the current color scheme. Common Pitfall When customizing an existing preset, your token overrides may be ignored if you don't properly account for color scheme variations. If the original preset defines a token using the colorScheme property, but your customization only provides a direct value, your override will be ignored because the colorScheme property takes precedence over direct values and the system will continue using the preset's scheme-specific values. When customizing tokens that are not defined with colorScheme in the original preset, your customizations will be applied successfully regardless of how you structure them; whether direct or under colorScheme. Best Practices Check how tokens are defined in the preset before customizing from the source . Always maintain the same structure (direct value or colorScheme) as the original preset. Consider both light and dark mode values when overriding scheme-dependent tokens. This approach ensures your customizations will be applied correctly regardless of the user's selected color scheme.

## Component

The design tokens of a specific component is defined at components layer. Overriding components tokens is not the recommended approach if you are building your own style, building your own preset should be preferred instead. This configuration is global and applies to all card components, in case you need to customize a particular component on a page locally, view the Scoped CSS section for an example.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    components: {
        card: {
            colorScheme: {
                light: {
                    root: {
                        background: '{surface.0}',
                        color: '{surface.700}'
                    },
                    subtitle: {
                        color: '{surface.500}'
                    }
                },
                dark: {
                    root: {
                        background: '{surface.900}',
                        color: '{surface.0}'
                    },
                    subtitle: {
                        color: '{surface.400}'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Define Preset

The definePreset utility is used to customize an existing preset during the PrimeVue setup. The first parameter is the preset to customize and the second is the design tokens to override.

```vue
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
import { definePreset } from '@primeuix/themes';
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    //Your customizations, see the following sections for examples
});

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    theme: {
        preset: MyPreset
    }
 });
```

## Extend

The theming system can be extended by adding custom design tokens and additional styles. This feature provides a high degree of customization, allowing you to adjust styles according to your needs, as you are not limited to the default tokens. The example preset configuration adds a new accent button with custom button.accent.color and button.accent.inverse.color tokens. It is also possible to add tokens globally to share them within the components.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    components: {
        // custom button tokens and additional style
        button: {
            extend: {
                accent: {
                    color: '#f59e0b',
                    inverseColor: '#ffffff'
                }
            }
        css: ({ dt }) => \`
.p-button-accent {
    background: \${dt('button.accent.color')};
    color: \${dt('button.accent.inverse.color')};
    transition-duration: \${dt('my.transition.fast')};
}
\`
        }
    },
    // common tokens and styles
    extend: {
        my: {
            transition: {
                slow: '0.75s'
                normal: '0.5s'
                fast: '0.25s'
            },
            imageDisplay: 'block' 
        }
    },
    css: ({ dt }) => \`
        /* Global CSS */
        img {
            display: \${dt('my.image.display')};
        }
    \`
});
```

## Focus Ring

Focus ring defines the outline width, style, color and offset. Let's use a thicker ring with the primary color for the outline.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    semantic: {
        focusRing: {
            width: '2px',
            style: 'dashed',
            color: '{primary.color}',
            offset: '1px'
        }
    }
});
```

## Font

There is no design for fonts as UI components inherit their font settings from the application.

## Forms

The design tokens of the form input components are derived from the form.field token group. This customization example changes border color to primary on hover. Any component that depends on this semantic token such as dropdown.hover.border.color and textarea.hover.border.color would receive the change.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    semantic: {
        colorScheme: {
            light: {
                formField: {
                    hoverBorderColor: '{primary.color}'
                }
            },
            dark: {
                formField: {
                    hoverBorderColor: '{primary.color}'
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Noir

The noir mode is the nickname of a variant that uses surface tones as the primary and requires and additional colorScheme configuration to implement. A sample preset configuration with black and white variants as the primary color;

```vue
const Noir = definePreset(Aura, {
    semantic: {
        primary: {
            50: '{zinc.50}',
            100: '{zinc.100}',
            200: '{zinc.200}',
            300: '{zinc.300}',
            400: '{zinc.400}',
            500: '{zinc.500}',
            600: '{zinc.600}',
            700: '{zinc.700}',
            800: '{zinc.800}',
            900: '{zinc.900}',
            950: '{zinc.950}'
        },
        colorScheme: {
            light: {
                primary: {
                    color: '{zinc.950}',
                    inverseColor: '#ffffff',
                    hoverColor: '{zinc.900}',
                    activeColor: '{zinc.800}'
                },
                highlight: {
                    background: '{zinc.950}',
                    focusBackground: '{zinc.700}',
                    color: '#ffffff',
                    focusColor: '#ffffff'
                }
            },
            dark: {
                primary: {
                    color: '{zinc.50}',
                    inverseColor: '{zinc.950}',
                    hoverColor: '{zinc.100}',
                    activeColor: '{zinc.200}'
                },
                highlight: {
                    background: 'rgba(250, 250, 250, .16)',
                    focusBackground: 'rgba(250, 250, 250, .24)',
                    color: 'rgba(255,255,255,.87)',
                    focusColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,.87)'
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Primary

The primary defines the main color palette, default value maps to the emerald primitive token. Let's setup to use indigo instead.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    semantic: {
        primary: {
            50: '{indigo.50}',
            100: '{indigo.100}',
            200: '{indigo.200}',
            300: '{indigo.300}',
            400: '{indigo.400}',
            500: '{indigo.500}',
            600: '{indigo.600}',
            700: '{indigo.700}',
            800: '{indigo.800}',
            900: '{indigo.900}',
            950: '{indigo.950}'
        }
    }
});
```

## Surface

The color scheme palette that varies between light and dark modes is specified with the surface tokens. Example below uses zinc for light mode and slategray for dark mode. With this setting, light mode, would have a grayscale tone and dark mode would include bluish tone.

```vue
const MyPreset = definePreset(Aura, {
    semantic: {
        colorScheme: {
            light: {
                surface: {
                    0: '#ffffff',
                    50: '{zinc.50}',
                    100: '{zinc.100}',
                    200: '{zinc.200}',
                    300: '{zinc.300}',
                    400: '{zinc.400}',
                    500: '{zinc.500}',
                    600: '{zinc.600}',
                    700: '{zinc.700}',
                    800: '{zinc.800}',
                    900: '{zinc.900}',
                    950: '{zinc.950}'
                }
            },
            dark: {
                surface: {
                    0: '#ffffff',
                    50: '{slate.50}',
                    100: '{slate.100}',
                    200: '{slate.200}',
                    300: '{slate.300}',
                    400: '{slate.400}',
                    500: '{slate.500}',
                    600: '{slate.600}',
                    700: '{slate.700}',
                    800: '{slate.800}',
                    900: '{slate.900}',
                    950: '{slate.950}'
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## D T

The $dt function returns the information about a token like the full path and value. This would be useful if you need to access tokens programmatically.

```vue
import { $dt } from '@primeuix/themes';

const duration = $dt('transition.duration');
/*
    duration: {
        name: '--transition-duration',
        variable: 'var(--p-transition-duration)',
        value: '0.2s'
    }
*/

const primaryColor = $dt('primary.color');
/*
    primaryColor: {
        name: '--primary-color',
        variable: 'var(--p-primary-color)',
        value: {
        light: {
            value: '#10b981',
            paths: {
                name: 'semantic.primary.color',
                binding: {
                    name: 'primitive.emerald.500'
                }
            }
        },
        dark: {
            value: '#34d399',
            paths: {
                name: 'semantic.primary.color',
                binding: {
                    name: 'primitive.emerald.400'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
*/
```

## Palette

Returns shades and tints of a given color from 50 to 950 as an object.

```vue
import { palette } from '@primeuix/themes';

// custom color
const values1 = palette('#10b981');

// copy an existing token set
const primaryColor = palette('{blue}');
```

## Update Preset

Merges the provided tokens to the current preset, an example would be changing the primary color palette dynamically.

```vue
import { updatePreset } from '@primeuix/themes';

const changePrimaryColor() {
    updatePreset({
        semantic: {
            primary: {
                50: '{indigo.50}',
                100: '{indigo.100}',
                200: '{indigo.200}',
                300: '{indigo.300}',
                400: '{indigo.400}',
                500: '{indigo.500}',
                600: '{indigo.600}',
                700: '{indigo.700}',
                800: '{indigo.800}',
                900: '{indigo.900}',
                950: '{indigo.950}'
            }
        }
    })
}
```

## Update Primary Palette

Updates the primary colors, this is a shorthand to do the same update using updatePreset .

```vue
import { updatePrimaryPalette } from '@primeuix/themes';

const changePrimaryColor() {
    updatePrimaryPalette({
        50: '{indigo.50}',
        100: '{indigo.100}',
        200: '{indigo.200}',
        300: '{indigo.300}',
        400: '{indigo.400}',
        500: '{indigo.500}',
        600: '{indigo.600}',
        700: '{indigo.700}',
        800: '{indigo.800}',
        900: '{indigo.900}',
        950: '{indigo.950}'
    });
}
```

## Update Surface Palette

Updates the surface colors, this is a shorthand to do the same update using updatePreset .

```vue
import { updateSurfacePalette } from '@primeuix/themes';

const changeSurfaces() {
    //changes surfaces both in light and dark mode
    updateSurfacePalette({
        50: '{zinc.50}',
        // ...
        950: '{zinc.950}'
    });
}

const changeLightSurfaces() {
    //changes surfaces only in light
    updateSurfacePalette({
        light: {
            50: '{zinc.50}',
            // ...
            950: '{zinc.950}'
        }
    });
}

const changeDarkSurfaces() {
    //changes surfaces only in dark mode
    updateSurfacePalette({
        dark: {
            50: '{zinc.50}',
            // ...
            950: '{zinc.950}'
        }
    });
}
```

## Use Preset

Replaces the current presets entirely, common use case is changing the preset dynamically at runtime.

```vue
import { usePreset } from '@primeuix/themes';

const onButtonClick() {
    usePreset(MyPreset);
}
```

# Unstyled Mode

Theming PrimeVue with alternative styling approaches.

## Architecture

The term unstyled is used to define an alternative styling approach instead of the default theming with design tokens. In unstyled mode the css variables of the design tokens and the css rule sets that utilize them are not included. Here is an example of an Unstyled Select, the core functionality and accessibility is provided whereas styling is not included. Unstyled components still need to be styled on your end, in the next sections, we'll cover the styling solutions for both modes.

## Example

Here is a sample that styles a button component with Tailwind CSS using pass through attributes. Before beginning, head over to the the pass through section at button documentation to learn more about the components internals section. We'll be using the root , label and icon elements to add a custom style.

```vue
<Button
    label="Search"
    icon="pi pi-search"
    unstyled
    pt:root="bg-teal-500 hover:bg-teal-700 active:bg-teal-900 cursor-pointer py-2 px-4 rounded-full border-0 flex gap-2"
    pt:label="text-white font-bold text-lg"
    pt:icon="text-white text-xl"
/>
```

## Global

A global configuration can be created at application level to avoid repetition via the global pt option so that the styles can be shared from a single location. A particular component can still override a global configuration with its own pt property.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    unstyled: true,
    pt: {
        button: {
            root: 'bg-teal-500 hover:bg-teal-700 active:bg-teal-900 cursor-pointer py-2 px-4 rounded-full border-0 flex gap-2',
            label: 'text-white font-bold text-lg',
            icon: 'text-white text-xl'
        },
        panel: {
            header: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast border-primary',
            content: 'border-primary text-lg text-primary-700',
            title: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast text-xl',
            pcToggleButton: {
                root: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast hover:text-primary hover:bg-primary-contrast'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Setup

Unstyled mode is enabled for the whole suite by enabling unstyled option during PrimeVue installation. Alternatively even in the default styled mode, a particular component can still be used as unstyled by adding the unstyled prop of the component.

## Volt

Tailwind CSS is perfect fit for the unstyled mode, PrimeTek has initiated a new UI library called Volt based on the unstyled PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS v4. Volt follows the code ownership model where the components are located in the application codebase rather than node_modules. All components within Volt are essentially wrapped versions of the unstyled PrimeVue equivalents, with an added layer of theming through Tailwind CSS v4. This approach, along with the templating features, offers complete control over the theming and presentation.

# Pass Through

The Pass Through attributes is an API to access the internal DOM Structure of the components.

## Basic

Each component has a special pt property to define an object with keys corresponding to the available DOM elements. Each value can either be a string, an object or a function that returns a string or an object to define the arbitrary properties to apply to the element such as styling, aria, data-* or custom attributes. If the value is a string or a function that returns a string, it is considered as a class definition and added to the class attribute of the element. Every component documentation has a dedicated section to document the available section names exposed via PT. Most common usage of pt is styling and customization. The class and style properties support the exact syntax of the corresponding Vue bindings like arrays, objects and conditionals. Example below styles an unstyled Panel component with Tailwind CSS library.

```vue
<Panel header="Header" toggleable
    :pt="{
        root: 'border border-primary rounded-xl p-4',
        header: (options) => ({
            id: 'myPanelHeader',
            style: {
                'user-select': 'none'
            },
            class: ['flex items-center justify-between text-primary font-bold']
        }),
        content: { class: 'text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-200 mt-4' },
        title: 'text-xl',
        toggler: () => 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast hover:text-primary hover:bg-primary-contrast'
    }">
    <p class="m-0">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
        Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
    </p>
</Panel>
```

## Custom CSS

The global property has a css option to define custom css that belongs to a global pt configuration. Common use case of this feature is defining global styles and animations related to the pass through configuration.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    pt: {
        global: {
            css: \`
                .my-button {
                    border-width: 2px;
                }
            \`
        },
        button: {
            root: 'my-button'
        }
    }
});
```

## Declarative

The declarative syntax provides an alternative to the programmatic syntax. The attributes that start with pt are interpreted differently by the component based on the format below. An IDE extension is also being planned to autocomplete the values for better developer experience in the future. Here is another example using both syntax alternatives for the same options.

## Global

Defines the shared pass through properties per component type. For example, with the configuration below all panel headers have the bg-primary style class and all autocomplete components have a fixed width. These settings can be overridden by a particular component as components pt property has higher precedence over global pt .

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue, {
    pt: {
        panel: {
            header: {
                class: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast'
            }
        },
        autocomplete: {
            input: {
                root: 'w-64' // OR { class: 'w-64' }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Introduction

In traditional 3rd party UI libraries, users are limited to the API provided by component author. This API commonly consists of props, events and slots. Whenever a requirement emerges for a new customization option in the API, the component author needs to develop and publish it with a new release. Vision of PrimeTek is Your components, not ours . The pass through feature is a key element to implement this vision by exposing the component internals in order to apply arbitrary attributes and listeners to the DOM elements. The primary advantage of this approach is that it frees you from being restricted by the main component API. We recommend considering the pass-through feature whenever you need to tailor a component that lacks a built-in feature for your specific requirement. Two videos are available at PrimeTV youtube channel, first one is an introduction and second one covers a unique case that is solved by the pass-through.

## Lifecycle

Lifecycle hooks of components are exposed as pass through using the hooks property so that callback functions can be registered. Available callbacks are onBeforeCreate , onCreated , onBeforeUpdate , onUpdated , onBeforeMount , onMounted , onBeforeUnmount and onUnmounted . Refer to the Vue.js documentation for detailed information about lifecycle hooks.

```vue
<Panel header="Header" :pt="panelPT">
    Content
</Panel>
```

## PC Prefix

Section names prefixed with pc denote PrimeVue components, distinguishing them from standard DOM elements and indicating the necessity for a nested structure. For example, the "badge" section is identified as pcBadge because the button component incorporates the badge component internally.

```vue
<Button
    type="button"
    label="Messages"
    icon="pi pi-inbox"
    badge="2"
    variant="outlined"
    severity="secondary"
    :pt="{
        root: '!px-4 !py-3',
        icon: '!text-xl !text-violet-500 dark:!text-violet-400',
        label: '!text-lg !text-violet-500 dark:!text-violet-400',
        pcBadge: {
            root: '!bg-violet-500 dark:!bg-violet-400 !text-white dark:!text-black'
        }
    }"
/>
```

## UsePassThrough

An existing pass through configuration is customized with the usePassThrough utility. The first parameter is the object to customize, the second parameter is the customizations and the final parameter is the merge strategy. The mergeSections defines whether the sections from the main configuration gets added and the mergeProps controls whether to override or merge the defined props. Defaults are true for mergeSections and false for mergeProps .

# Icons

PrimeIcons is the default icon library of PrimeVue with over 250 open source icons developed by PrimeTek. PrimeIcons library is optional as PrimeVue components can use any icon with templating.

## Basic

PrimeIcons use the pi pi-&#123;icon&#125; syntax such as pi pi-check . A standalone icon can be displayed using an element such as i or span

```vue
<i class="pi pi-check"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times"></i>
<span class="pi pi-search"></span>
<span class="pi pi-user"></span>
```

## Color

Icon color is defined with the color property which is inherited from parent by default.

```vue
<i class="pi pi-check" style="color: slateblue"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times" style="color: green"></i>
<i class="pi pi-search" style="color: 'var(--p-primary-color)'"></i>
<i class="pi pi-user" style="color: #708090"></i>
```

## Constants

Constants API is available to reference icons easily when used programmatically.

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <Menu :model="items" />
    </div>
</template>

<script>
import { PrimeIcons } from '@primevue/core/api';

export default {
    data() {
        return {
            items: [
                {
                    label: 'File',
                    items: [
                        { label: 'New', icon: PrimeIcons.PLUS },
                        { label: 'Open', icon: PrimeIcons.DOWNLOAD }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        };
    }
};
<\/script>
```

## Download

PrimeIcons is available at npm, run the following command to download it to your project.

```vue
npm install primeicons
```

## Figma

PrimeIcons library is now available on Figma Community . By adding them as a library, you can easily use these icons in your designs.

## Import

CSS file of the icon library needs to be imported in styles.scss of your application.

## List

Here is the full list of PrimeIcons. More icons will be added periodically and you may also request new icons at the issue tracker.

## Size

Size of an icon is controlled with the font-size property of the element.

```vue
<i class="pi pi-check" style="font-size: 1rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times" style="font-size: 1.5rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-search" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-user" style="font-size: 2.5rem"></i>
```

## Spin

Special pi-spin class applies infinite rotation to an icon.

```vue
<i class="pi pi-spin pi-spinner" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-spin pi-cog" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
```

# Custom Icons

PrimeVue components can be used with any icon library using the templating features.

## FontAwesome

Font Awesome is a popular icon library with a wide range of icons.

```vue
<Select>
    <template #dropdownicon>
        <i class="fa-light fa-chevron-down"></i>
    </template>
</Select>
```

## Image

Any type of image can be used as an icon.

```vue
<Select>
    <template #dropdownicon>
        <img alt="dropdown icon" src="/assets/icons/arrow_down.png">
    </template>
</Select>
```

## Material

Material icons is the official icon library based on Google Material Design.

```vue

    <template #dropdownicon>
        <span class="material-icons">arrow_drop_down</span>
    </template>
</Select>
```

## SVG

Inline SVGs are embedded inside the dom.

```vue
<Select>
    <template #dropdownicon>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <g id="chevron-down">
                <path d="M12,15.25a.74.74,0,0,1-.53-.22l-5-5A.75.75,0,0,1,7.53,9L12,13.44,16.47,9A.75.75,0,0,1,17.53,10l-5,5A.74.74,0,0,1,12,15.25Z"/>

# Forms

The PrimeVue Forms library provides comprehensive form state management with built-in validation support.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Form does not require any roles and attributes. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## Basic

All PrimeVue form components are designed for seamless integration with the forms library. Instead of using the standard v-model , the name property is used to link a state object that tracks values, errors, and actions. The form component provides four key properties for state management.

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :initialValues :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.username?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.username.error?.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## Download

Forms add-on is available for download on npm registry.

```vue
# Using npm
npm install @primevue/forms

# Using yarn
yarn add @primevue/forms

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @primevue/forms
```

## Dynamic

This section demonstrates how to create a dynamic form using a custom Form component. It showcases an example where form fields are generated dynamically based on the provided configuration, allowing for flexible form structures. The components named Dynamic* shown in this example are not built-in, and only available for sampling purposes. First form uses a declarative approach whereas second form goes for a programmatic approach. We suggest running this sample in StackBlitz to view the comprehensive implementation.

```vue
<Fieldset legend="Form 1" pt:content:class="flex justify-center">
    <DynamicForm @submit="onFormSubmit('Form 1', $event)">
        <DynamicFormField groupId="userId_1" name="username">
            <DynamicFormLabel>Username</DynamicFormLabel>
            <DynamicFormControl defaultValue="PrimeVue" fluid :schema="userNameSchema" />
            <DynamicFormMessage />
        </DynamicFormField>

<Fieldset legend="Form 2" pt:content:class="flex justify-center">
    <DynamicForm :fields @submit="onFormSubmit('Form 2', $event)" />
</Fieldset>
```

## Import

The form component is responsible for managing the form state and must encapsulate the form fields.

```vue
import { Form } from '@primevue/forms';
```

## Resolvers

Validations are implemented with the resolver property. A custom resolver is responsible for handling the validation and returning an errors object with key-value pairs where key is the form field name and value is an array of error object data. For productivity, we recommend using a schema validation library instead of building your own custom validation logic. The forms library provide built-in resolvers for popular options including Zod , Yup , Joi , Valibot , and Superstruct that can be imported from @primevue/forms/resolvers path.

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :initialValues :resolver="resolver" @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.username?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.username.error.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## States

The $form object tracks the state management of the fields. Each field is linked with the name property. View the FormFieldState type in the API documentation for details about each property.

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :initialValues :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="grid lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4 w-full">
    <div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-4">
        <InputText name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" class="w-full sm:w-56" />
        <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" class="w-full sm:w-56" />
    </div>
    <Fieldset legend="Form States" class="h-80 overflow-auto">
        <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap">{{ $form }}</pre>
    </Fieldset>
</Form>
```

## Submit

The submit callback returns an object that encapsulates the form's validity, any existing errors, and its current state. This enables access to the form values, validation status, and any errors present at the time of submission. View the FormSubmitEvent in the API documentation for more information about the available event data.

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :initialValues :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-60">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.username?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.username.error.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <Password name="password" placeholder="Password" :feedback="false" toggleMask fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.password?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">
            <ul class="my-0 px-4 flex flex-col gap-1">
                <li v-for="(error, index) of $form.password.errors" :key="index">{{ error.message }}</li>
            </ul>
        </Message>
    </div>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## ValidateOn

Form component supports flexible validation triggers, allowing validation on value updates, blur events, form mount, or submission. These behaviors can be configured at form level or on specific fields via the validateOnValueUpdate , validateOnBlur , validateOnMount , and validateOnSubmit options of the formControl property. In this example, form disables validateOnValueUpdate and enables validateOnBlur at form level, and validates firstName on mount. The firstName field, overrides the form level setting locally.

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :initialValues :resolver :validateOnValueUpdate="false" :validateOnBlur="true" :validateOnMount="['firstName']" @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.username?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.username.error.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="firstName" type="text" placeholder="First Name" fluid :formControl="{ validateOnValueUpdate: true }" />
        <Message v-if="$form.firstName?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.firstName.error.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText name="lastName" type="text" placeholder="Last Name" fluid />
        <Message v-if="$form.lastName?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.lastName.error.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## Built In

Although PrimeVue components have built-in support for the Form API, you may still prefer to utilize the components as wrapped with the FormField. This is a matter of preference, for example in case you are also using FormField for other 3rd party components, your own custom components, and native elements, for consistency it may be an option.

```vue
<Form :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="username" initialValue="" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText type="text" placeholder="Username" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## FormField

The FormField is a helper component that provides validation and tracking for input elements, offering a more flexible structure to bind PrimeVue, non-PrimeVue components or native HTML elements to Form API. Additionally, with props like validateOn* , initialValue , resolver , and name , behaviors can be controlled directly from this component.

```vue
import { FormField } from '@primevue/forms';
```

## Non Prime Vue

Form API is not strictly tied to PrimeVue components, providing a flexible way to manage validation and state for any native HTML elements, your own custom components or third-party libraries.

```vue
<Form :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="username" initialValue="" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Username" :class="[{ error: $field?.invalid }]" v-bind="$field.props" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="password" initialValue="PrimeVue" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <input v-model="$field.value" type="password" placeholder="Password" :class="[{ error: $field?.invalid }]" @input="$field.onInput" @blur="$field.onBlur" @change="$field.onChange" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## Resolver

Each FormField can have its own dedicated resolver, allowing you to define custom validation logic for individual fields. This flexibility enables tailored validation rules, ensuring that each form field meets specific criteria.

```vue
<Form :initialValues :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-80">
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="username" initialValue="" :resolver="zodUserNameResolver" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText type="text" placeholder="Username" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="firstname" initialValue="" :resolver="yupFirstNameResolver" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText type="text" placeholder="First Name" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="lastname" initialValue="" :resolver="valibotLastNameResolver" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <InputText type="text" placeholder="Last Name" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="password" initialValue="" :resolver="customPasswordResolver" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <Password type="text" placeholder="Password" :feedback="false" toggleMask fluid />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" name="details" class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <Textarea placeholder="Details" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

## Template

It renders as a HTML div element, but this behavior can be modified using the as and asChild props to render different HTML elements or to pass a custom component, allowing for greater flexibility in form structure.

```vue
<Form :resolver @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full sm:w-56">
    <FormField v-slot="$field" as="section" name="username" initialValue="" class="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <InputText type="text" placeholder="Username" />
        <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
    </FormField>
    <FormField v-slot="$field" asChild name="password" initialValue="">
        <section class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <Password type="text" placeholder="Password" :feedback="false" toggleMask fluid />
            <Message v-if="$field?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $field.error?.message }}</Message>
        </section>
    </FormField>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

# Auto Import

On-demand PrimeVue components with auto imports and tree-shaking.

## Example

A complete example using PrimeVue with auto imports is available at the playground .

## Overview

PrimeVue components need to be imported and configured individually. In the next section, we'll cleanup the code using auto imports.

```vue
import { createApp } from "vue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
import InputText from 'primevue/inputtext';
import Button from 'primevue/button';
import App from './App.vue'
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(PrimeVue);
app.component('InputText', InputText);
app.component('Button', Button);
```

## Unplugin

The unplugin-vue-components library can automatically import and register PrimeVue components with the help of @primevue/auto-import-resolver . Begin with installing the packages as dev dependencies. Next step would be adding the PrimeVueResolver at vite.config using the Components plugin. That's it, now the initialization code can be refactored as the following. For configuration like namespacing, visit the official documentation .

# Install PrimeVue with CND

Setting up PrimeVue in a project using CDN.

## CreateApp

Create an app container element and setup the application using createApp .

```vue
<body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"><\/script>

    <div id="app">
    </div>

    <script>
        const { createApp, ref } = Vue;

        const app = createApp({
            setup() {

            }
        });

        app.mount('#app');
    <\/script>
</body>
```

## Example

A complete example using a PrimeVue DatePicker. You can also view this sample live at Stackblitz .

```vue
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>PrimeVue + CDN</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"><\/script>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/primevue/umd/primevue.min.js"><\/script>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/aura.js"><\/script>

        <div id="app">
            <p-datepicker v-model="date"></p-datepicker>
            <br /><br />
            {{ date }}
        </div>

        <script>
            const { createApp, ref } = Vue;

            const app = createApp({
                setup() {
                const date = ref();

                return {
                    date
                };
                },
            });

            app.use(PrimeVue.Config, {
                theme: {
                    preset: PrimeUIX.Themes.Aura
                }
            });

            app.component('p-datepicker', PrimeVue.DatePicker);

            app.mount('#app');
        <\/script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Plugin

PrimeVue plugin is required to be installed as an application plugin to set up the default configuration .

```vue
app.use(PrimeVue.Config);
```

## Script

You can use PrimeVue and Vue.js from a CDN with a script tag. This approach does not involve any build step, and is suitable for enhancing static HTML. This guide uses unpkg however other providers such as jsdeliver and cdnjs can also be used.

```vue
https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js
https://unpkg.com/primevue/umd/primevue.min.js
https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/aura.js  // see theming for alternatives
```

## Theming

Include the theme preset via a script element after adding PrimeVue, valid options are Aura, Lara, Nora and Material.

```vue
<!-- <script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/{preset}.js"><\/script> -->

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/aura.js"><\/script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/lara.js"><\/script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/nora.js"><\/script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@primeuix/themes/umd/material.js"><\/script>

# Install PrimeVue with Nuxt

Setting up PrimeVue in a Nuxt project.

## autoImport

The auto import feature registers components automatically with tree shaking support. Defaults to true , when disabled use include/exclude options of components and directives for manual registration. Use the prefix in components and directives to add a prefix for registration.

## Download

PrimeVue is available for download on npm registry along with the official @primevue/nuxt-module .

```vue
# Using npm
npm install primevue @primeuix/themes
npm install --save-dev @primevue/nuxt-module

# Using yarn
yarn add primevue @primeuix/themes
yarn add --dev @primevue/nuxt-module

# Using pnpm
pnpm add primevue @primeuix/themes
pnpm add -D @primevue/nuxt-module
```

## Examples

Nuxt based samples with different options are available at PrimeVue examples repository.

## Module

In nuxt.config file, add the @primevue/nuxt-module to the modules section and define primevue object for the configuration of the module.

## Next Steps

Welcome to the Prime UI Ecosystem! Once you have PrimeVue up and running, we recommend exploring the following resources to gain a deeper understanding of the library. Global configuration Customization of styles Pass through attributes Getting support

## Styled Mode

Styled mode provides pre-skinned components, default theme is Aura with emerald as the primary color. See the styled mode documentation for details. Install the @primeuix/themes add-on package as the themes are not included in PrimeVue by default. Configure the module to use a theme like Aura.

## Theme

Configure the module to use a theme like Aura.

```vue
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
        '@primevue/nuxt-module'
    ],
    primevue: {
        options: {
            theme: {
                preset: Aura
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Unstyled Mode

In unstyled mode, the components do not include any CSS so you'd need to style the components on your end, this is especially useful when building your own UI library on top of PrimeVue. Visit the Unstyled mode documentation for more information and examples.

## Verify

The nuxt-primevue module registers the components automatically with tree-shaking support so you may start using them instantly.

```vue
<Button label="Verify" />
```

## Video

A video tutorial that goes through steps of setting up PrimeVue with the nuxt-primevue module.

## components

When autoImport is disabled, use the include and exclude for manual registration. The components to import and register are defined with the include option using a string array. When the value is ignored or set using the * alias, all of the components are registered. In case all components are imported, particular components can still be excluded with the exclude option. By default, for compatibility reasons, Chart and Editor components are excluded. To include them simply set the exclude option to an empty list. Use the prefix option to give a prefix to the registered component names. Component registration can be customized further by implementing the name function that gets an object representing the import metadata. name is the label of the component, as is the default export name and from is the import path.

## composables

Determines the composables to use, when default value is ignored or set as * all composables are imported.

## directives

When autoImport is disabled, use the include and exclude for manual registration. The names of the directives to import and register are provided using the include property. When the value is ignored or set using the * alias, all of the directives are registered. Similar to components, certain directives can be excluded and name registration can be customized.

## importPT

Configures the global pass through import path. mycustompt.js file defines the configuration and exports it.

## importTheme

Configures the theme configuration path for the customizations of a theme in styled mode. The mytheme.js file contains the theme configuration.

## options

Main configuration settings of PrimeVue, refer to the configuration documentation for details.

```vue
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
        '@primevue/nuxt-module'
    ],
    primevue: {
        options: {
            ripple: true,
            inputVariant: 'filled',
            theme: {
                preset: Aura,
                options: {
                    prefix: 'p',
                    darkModeSelector: 'system',
                    cssLayer: false
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## usePrimeVue

The module installs the PrimeVue plugin by default. Disable this option if you prefer to configure PrimeVue manually e.g. with a Nuxt plugin.

```vue
primevue: {
    usePrimeVue: true | false
}
```

# Terms and Conditions

Theme Designer is the ultimate tool to customize and design your own themes featuring a visual editor, figma to theme code, cloud storage, and migration assistant.

## Dashboard

Dashboard is the entry point of the designer. The license key can be configured at this view before getting started with the full set of features. In the My Themes section, you're able to create a theme, and manage existing themes. A theme can be renamed, duplicated and downloaded using the button.

## License

A license key is required to be able to use all the services provided by the designer. Without a license, the visual editor is still available for trial purposes with various options such as downloads, and cloud storage disabled. The license key can be purchased at PrimeStore , it is valid for 1 year and needs to be renewed manually after a year.

## Limitations

Current known technical limitations are listed at this section. The border width token in Figma does not support multiple values, related issue .

## Migration Assistant

Prime UI libraries continue to evolve with each version. New tokens are likely to be added with each major release, in order to keep your themes up to date the migration assistant is available featuring automated migration. The Check for Updates option initially scans a theme for any missing tokens. This tool does not override the values of existing tokens, and only adds missing tokens if necessary. Still, it is recommended to duplicate your theme as a backup and run a preview before the migration. Depending on the result, you may choose to proceed with the migration process. In case there are missing tokens, your theme would receive them with placeholder values so it is recommended to take a note of them before migration and then visit the components to replace the placeholder values with actual values of your choice. These types of newly added tokens would be highlighed in Editor.

## Overview

The theming api is open and source freely available with an extensive documentation. Theme Designer is a tool build on top of this theming api with important features to make theming easier. Designer consists of 4 key features; The visual editor provides a UI to edit the complete set of tokens. The figma to theme code generator is extremely useful to automate the design to code process and integrates seamlessly with the Figma UI Kit. The themes are saved in the cloud storage to be accessible from anywhere and any device and finally the migration assistant automatically updates your themes to the latest library version.

## Designer Api

## Figma

Token Studio in Figma is the starting point of a continuous integration pipeline. You can connect a remote repository to sync your tokens data so that changes are saved remotely instead of locally. Token Studio offers various remote storage options such as GitHub , GitLab and Bitbucket . Refer to these documentations based on your environment before proceeding to the integrations in the next section.

## Live Preview

After your CI pipeline completes successfully, your theme also becomes available in the Prime UI Theme Designer. Navigate to the Prime UI library website. Click the ⚙️ icon at topbar to open up Designer Editor. Sign in with your license key and pass key credentials. Then select your theme from the available options to apply it across all demos and website content. Note that CI-generated themes are provided in read-only mode for preview purposes only and cannot be edited within the Theme Designer. The Migration Assistant is available to identify any missing tokens in your preset; however, if tokens are missing, they must be added manually in Figma as needed.

## Overview

The Figma UI Kit and the theming api is fully synchorized, meaning the design tokens in Figma map to the corresponding properties in a theme preset. The Theme Designer offers a feature to create a theme by uploading a tokens.json file that is exported from the Token Studio plugin in Figma. Once the theme is converted, it can either be edited further in the visual editor or downloaded as a zip file to access the full code. Visit the Figma section at the designer documentation for more information. Manually exporting the tokens file from Figma and uploading it to the online designer tool may quickly become tedious in active development cycles. As a solution, theme designer provides a remote API that can be integrated into your CI pipeline.

## Video Tutorial

Before diving into the implementation details, if you would like to understand the final outcome and see how the solution operates, please refer to the video tutorial for a comprehensive walkthrough and demonstration.

## Bitbucket

The BitBucket integration is implemented by executing a custom pipe whenever the tokens file changes. 1. Add Secret Key to Repository Secrets Go to your BitBucket repository. Navigate to Repository Settings > Repository Variables . Give a name such as: THEME_DESIGNER_SECRET_KEY . Value: Your API key from Prime Theme Designer. Click Add . 2. Add the pipe configuration to your bitbucket-pipelines.yml Define the configuration parameters for the Designer API and add the pipe as a runnable script to the action. Notice that, the referenced pipe is executed as a script rather than a pipe from the BitBucket pipe registry as PrimeTek currently has no intentions to maintain an official pipe for BitBucket. You may further improve this example by building a dockerized pipe that is accessible in the BitBucket Registry to refer it with the pipe config in yml. 3. Test Integration Edit a token in Token Studio in Figma and click Push to BitBucket button to update the tokens file in your Git repository, triggering the configured BitBucket Pipe. The pipe then sends the updated file content to the Theme Designer API, receives the generated theme code, and commits the resulting changes back to your repository. An example repository is available at BitBucket that you may use as a starter.

```

## Base

In the new theme section, all of the built-in themes are available to use as the base. These are; Aura , Material , Lara and Nora . Each have their own characteristics, and it is recommended to choose the one that best suits your requirements.

## Figma

The Figma UI Kit and the theming api is fully synchorized, meaning the design tokens in Figma map to the CSS variables in the code. The mapping is created via the Token Studio at Figma which allows exporting a single json file. The Designer is able to interpret this file and transform it to an actual theme. In case your UI Kit version is older, the transformation process marks the missing tokens and recommends an auto migration via the migration assistant. This is an automated workflow and eliminates the manual design to code during the handoff process. If you have UI designers in your team, the recommended approach is using Figma for the actual design process and utilizing the designer for transformation, preview and download purposes. CI Pipeline Recommended approach is setting up the CI Pipeline flow as manually exporting the tokens file from Figma and uploading it to the online designer tool may quickly become tedious in active development cycles. As a solution, theme designer provides a remote API that can be integrated into your flow. Visit the CI Pipeline documentation for comprehensive information and examples for GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. Manual Flow Instead of setting a CI pipeline, for quick prototyping purposes, you may also choose to use to manually export a tokens json file and then upload it to the designer. Note that, this flow would get tedious and repetitive in active development cycles when compared to an automated CI pipeline. Open the PrimeOne UI Kit in which you've modified tokens. In the Tokens Studio plugin, navigate to the Tools menu and select Export to file/folder. When the Export tokens modal appears, make sure the Single file tab is selected. Check the All tokens sets option, then click Export . In case you utilize custom tokens, create a new token set named custom and define your tokens under this set to make sure they are also exported to the theme code. When creating a new theme at Theme Designer, choose the Import Figma Tokens option and import the json file. Video Tutorial A tutorial is available demonstrating how the handoff process can be automated between the design team and the development team. -->

## Custom Tokens

Custom tokens allow bringing in your own design tokens to the theme to go beyond the built-in ones. A design token requires a name and a value where the value can be a static value like a color or another token. The name of the token should be a dot seperated lowercase value e.g. accent.color . For example, a custom token name can be defined as accent.color and the value can either be a value like #eab308 or another token such as {yellow.50} . Custom tokens can also refer to each other, e.g. selection.background custom token can define {accent.color} as a value. If you have created a theme from Figma, use the name custom as the name of your token set group. This keyword is special since the import tool will populate the custom tokens using this set in tokens json file.

## Intelligent Completion

The editor is packed with features for improved user experience. The input fields in the editor are capable of displaying a color preview when the value is a color, and beginning the value with a curly brace opens up the autocompletion feature to list the available tokens to choose from. The pi-sort-alt symbol over the input, transfers the token between the common tokens and color scheme specific tokens so that you are able to define tokens based on light and dark mode as well.

## Token Sets

The theming architecture is based on primitive, semantic and components tokens. The visual editor, displays a dedicated section for each set. For basic purposes such as customizing the primary and surface colors, primitive and semantic sections would be more than enough. The component tokens are displayed per route so navigate to the component page first to view the tokens of the specific component.

## Typography

The components are not opinionated about the typography. Important properties such as the font family, font size, and line-height do not have design tokens since they can be inherited from the document. For preview purposes, the settings tab displays options to customize the base font and the font family of the document. These values are not available in the generated theme and need to be applied to your application at the document level.

# Tailwind CSS

Integration between PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS both in styled and unstyled modes.

## Animations

The plugin also adds extended animation utilities that can be used with the styleclass and animateonscroll directives. Enter and Leave In addition to the prebuilt animations, you may also build your own declaratively using the animate-enter and animate-leave along with the opacity, rotate, scale and translate parameters. These animations work perfectly with the AnimateOnScroll directive, visit this directive for various examples.

<div class="py-8 overflow-hidden">
    <div :class="\`rounded-border bg-primary w-16 h-16 mx-auto animate-\${animation} animate-once animate-duration-1000\`"></div>
</div>
```

## Dark Mode

In styled mode, PrimeVue uses the system as the default darkModeSelector in theme configuration. If you have a dark mode switch in your application, ensure that darkModeSelector is aligned with the Tailwind dark variant for seamless integration. Note that, this particular configuration isn't required if you're utilizing the default system color scheme. Suppose that, the darkModeSelector is set as my-app-dark in PrimeVue. Tailwind v4 Add a custom variant for dark with a custom selector. Tailwind v3 Use the plugins option in your Tailwind config file to configure the plugin.

## Extensions

The plugin extends the default configuration with a new set of utilities whose values are derived from the PrimeVue theme in use. All variants and breakpoints are supported e.g. dark:sm:hover:bg-primary . Color Palette Class Property primary-[50-950] Primary color palette. surface-[0-950] Surface color palette. primary Default primary color. primary-contrast Default primary contrast color. primary-emphasis Default primary emphasis color. border-surface Content border color. bg-emphasis Emphasis background e.g. hovered element. bg-highlight Highlight background. bg-highlight-emphasis Highlight background with emphasis. rounded-border Border radius. text-color Text color with emphasis. text-color-emphasis Default primary emphasis color. text-muted-color Secondary text color. text-muted-color-emphasis Secondary text color with emphasis.

## Override

Tailwind utilities may not be able to override the default styling of components due to css specificity, there are two possible solutions; Important and CSS Layer. Important Use the ! as a prefix to enforce the styling. This is not the recommend approach, and should be used as last resort to avoid adding unnecessary style classes to your bundle. Tailwind v4 Tailwind v3 CSS Layer CSS Layer provides control over the css specificity so that Tailwind utilities can safely override components. Tailwind v4 Ensure primevue layer is after theme and base , but before the other Tailwind layers such as utilities . No change in the CSS configuration is required. Tailwind v3 The primevue layer should be between base and utilities. Tailwind v3 does not use native layer so needs to be defined with CSS.

## Overview

Tailwind CSS is a popular CSS framework based on a utility-first design. The core provides flexible CSS classes with predefined CSS rules to build your own UI elements. For example, instead of an opinionated btn class as in Bootstrap, Tailwind offers primitive classes like bg-blue-500 , rounded and p-4 to apply a button. Tailwind is an outstanding CSS library, however it lacks a true comprehensive UI suite when combined with Vue.js, this is where PrimeVue comes in by providing a wide range of highly accessible and feature rich UI component library. The core of PrimeVue does not depend on Tailwind CSS, instead we provide the necessary integration points such as the primeui tailwind plugin or a spin-off UI library called Volt based on unstyled PrimeVue. Tailwind CSS and PrimeVue can be used together via two main approaches to choose from. First approach is using Tailwind CSS around the styled PrimeVue components as demonstrated in the samples section below. The second alternative approach takes the integration a step further by replacing the default design token based styled mode with the unstyled mode and utilizing Tailwind CSS within the component internals via pass-through feature. A spin-off library from the PrimeTek UI ecosystem has been created based on this advanced integration called VOLT .

## Plugin

The tailwindcss-primeui is an official plugin by PrimeTek to provide first class integration between a Prime UI library like PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to work both in styled and unstyled modes. In styled mode, for instance the semantic colors such as primary and surfaces are provided as Tailwind utilities e.g. bg-primary , text-surface-500 , text-muted-color . If you haven't already done so, start by integrating Tailwind into your project. Detailed steps for this process can be found in the Tailwind documentation . After successfully installing Tailwind, proceed with the installation of the PrimeUI plugin. This single npm package comes with two libraries: the CSS version is compatible with Tailwind v4, while the JS version is designed for Tailwind v3. Tailwind v4 In the CSS file that contains the tailwindcss import, add the tailwindcss-primeui import as well. Tailwind v3 Use the plugins option in your Tailwind config file to configure the plugin.

## Volt UI

Volt is ideal for developers who prefer customizing component styles using Tailwind CSS rather than the default design token-based styling. If you do not have this use case and prefer the default styled mode for PrimeVue, while using Tailwind CSS only for other requirements such as layout, you can proceed to the next section. Volt is an open source UI component library implemented with the Unstyled PrimeVue components and Tailwind CSS. Volt follows the Code Ownership model where the components live in your application code base as your own UI library rather than imported from node_modules as a 3rd party. Main benefit of this approach is full control over styling and ease of customization. Internally a Volt component wraps its PrimeVue counterpart, removes the default design token based theming and applies Tailwind utility classes via the pass through attributes feature. Volt components are designed to be customized with Tailwind CSS and do not require separate updates. They serve as wrappers around PrimeVue components, so maintenance is handled simply by updating the PrimeVue version.

## Color Palette

PrimeVue color palette as utility classes.

```vue
<div class="flex flex-col gap-12">
    <div class="flex gap-6 flex-wrap">
        <div class="rounded-border p-4 border border-transparent flex items-center justify-center bg-primary hover:bg-primary-emphasis text-primary-contrast font-medium flex-auto transition-colors">primary</div>
        <div class="rounded-border p-4 border border-transparent flex items-center justify-center bg-highlight hover:bg-highlight-emphasis font-medium flex-auto transition-colors">highlight</div>
        <div class="rounded-border p-4 border border-surface flex items-center justify-center text-muted-color hover:text-color hover:bg-emphasis font-medium flex-auto transition-colors">box</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Form

Using Tailwind utilities for the responsive layout of a form with PrimeVue components.

```vue
<div class="flex flex-col gap-6 w-full sm:w-auto">
    <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center gap-6">
        <div class="flex-auto">

# UI Kit

Design files for PrimeVue Components.

## Adding Prime Icons

PrimeOne uses PrimeIcons, the official icon library by PrimeTek. To use it effectively within your design system, you need to add PrimeIcons to your Figma environment by following these steps: Open the PrimeIcons file in Figma and move it to your team project. Publish the PrimeIcons file and enable it for all team files in your Team Settings. Return to your PrimeOne file. In the Libraries panel, click on the banner that says “Includes X missing libraries.” From the dropdown, select “ PrimeIcons (Community) ” and click the Swap Library button.

## Overview

PrimeOne is the official Figma library of UI components designed to match the implementations in the Prime UI Suites. The current iteration of PrimeOne is structured around the Aura Light and Aura Dark themes.

## Resources

PrimeOne for Figma takes full advantage of powerful Figma features such as components, variants, auto layout, styles, interactivity, and design tokens via Tokens Studio. If you're new to Figma or want to get the most out of PrimeOne, we recommend exploring the following resources: Tokens Studio Documentation - PrimeOne uses Tokens Studio for design token management. Visit the official docs to understand how it works and how to use it effectively. Figma's Best Practice Guides - Learn how to work efficiently with components, variants, and layouts. Figma's Official YouTube Channel - Tutorials and feature walkthroughs from the Figma team. Figmalion Newsletter - Stay updated with curated insights from the Figma community.

## Support

The community gathers on GitHub Discussions and Discord to ask questions, share ideas, and discuss the technology. For direct inquiries or suggestions, feel free to contact us at contact@primetek.com.tr .

## Token Sets

Primitive This set contains the most foundational tokens, such as base colors and border radius, elements that are considered “primitive” by nature. Semantic Includes essential system-wide tokens like primary, surface, and other shared design values It also defines tokens used across multiple component groups. For example, tokens under {form.field.*} are referenced by component-level tokens in InputText, MultiSelect, Checkbox, and other form components, enabling consistent styling across the board. Component These tokens are defined specifically for each component to allow deep customization While we've aimed to create dedicated tokens for every component state, many of them still reference the semantic or primitive tokens, allowing you to make global updates from a single place when needed. App Tokens in this set are not part of the PrimeUIX system. They are intended for values defined in your own application. The same applies to tokens used in our UI library showcases. For example, there is no dedicated font size token in PrimeUIX because font styles are not part of the design system. UI components inherit their font settings from the application. Custom If you're using the Figma to Theme feature and want your newly created custom tokens to appear in your Theme Designer themes, place them in this set. Even if you're not using the Theme Designer, we still recommend creating a separate set — or using the existing “Custom” set — for your own tokens. Making changes to the default sets, especially deleting tokens or altering reference values, can lead to inconsistencies with the library tokens and cause additional work during development.

## Update Prime One

When a new version of PrimeOne is released, follow the steps below to update your files: Download the latest version of PrimeOne from PrimeStore. Unzip the file and upload it to your Figma workspace. Publish the newly uploaded file as a library. In all consumer files, use Swap Library to point to the new version. Once the transition is complete, you can safely unpublish the old PrimeOne library Before each update, it's a good idea to review the Changelog on the Get Started page of the PrimeOne Figma file. Keep in mind that while Swap Library will update most components, any customized components may require manual review and adjustment.

## Components

How to change base font size? The base font size used in PrimeOne is 14px. Similar to how rem works in CSS, this is controlled by the {app.font.size} token located under the "app" set in Tokens Studio. When you change the value of this token, all size calculations will adjust accordingly based on the new value. To apply this change, you need to use the “Apply” function in Tokens Studio. However, we do not recommend using the “ Apply to Document ” option if the change affects the entire library, as it may lead to unexpected errors. Instead, go page by page and review the updates carefully before applying changes. Also note: not all token values in the library may be linked to {app.font.size} . So it's important to check components individually. After completing each page, verify the updated values under Local Variables and make manual adjustments if needed. Alternatively, you can use Export Styles & Variables to Figma in Tokens Studio to sync the updated values.

## Licence

Will purchasing a PrimeBlocks license include access to PrimeOne components? No. The PrimeBlocks license does not grant access to the PrimeOne UI Kit. They are separate products with individual licenses.

## Roadmap

Are there plans to add a Tailwind theme to the UI Kit? At this time, we do not plan to include Tailwind theme support in the Figma UI Kit.

## Tokens

Is Tokens Studio too slow? This might be caused by using the wrong Apply method when pushing your changes. Since PrimeOne is a large file, using Apply to Document can result in very long processing times. We recommend using Apply to Selection or Apply to Page instead for better performance.

## Updates

Will there be a completely new Figma file with each update, or will the current PrimeOne file be modified and versioned? Each update will come as a new Figma file—an updated version of the previous one. You can seamlessly transition to the new version in your consumer files using Figma's Swap Library feature. Will the PrimeOne UI Kit stay in sync with ongoing updates to the Prime UI Libraries? The PrimeOne UI Kit does not update in real time alongside the libraries. However, we regularly release updates to bridge the gap and ensure alignment with key changes. How will users receive new components when they're added? New components will be included in future updates to the UI Kit. Please note that these updates may not coincide immediately with library changes and may take some time to roll out. How frequently is the PrimeOne UI Kit updated? We don't follow a fixed release schedule. Updates are made as needed, based on significant changes or additions to the Prime UI libraries.

## Usage

What should we do after purchasing? I can't publish the Preview file? The Preview file is view-only , so it can't be published. To use the library, download the .fig file from PrimeStore and import it into your Figma workspace. Once imported, you'll be able to open the file and publish it as a library for use in your projects. How to change theme? After exporting your tokens as Figma Variables using the Themes option in Tokens Studio, theme switching must be handled using Figma's native Mode Switching feature. The Theme Switcher within the Tokens Studio plugin will no longer function once themes are bound to a Variable Collection — this applies to PrimeOne as well. Therefore, to switch between Light and Dark modes, you should always use Figma's built-in Mode Switching interface.

## Enabling

If you want to enable PrimeOne across all files in your team, follow these steps: Navigate to All Projects from the Teams section. Go to View Settings View Team Libraries . You can find this option in the dropdown menu next to your team name. Toggle PrimeOne "On" to make it available globally.

## Importing

Download the latest .fig UI Kit - From your PrimeStore panel, download the latest PrimeOne package. The archive contains the .fig UI Kit. Open Figma in Google Chrome - Launch Figma in Chrome (or another supported browser). Avoid using the Desktop app for this import. It's more reliable in-browser. Import into your Team project - Navigate to the Teams section in the left sidebar. Select your Team project where you want PrimeOne. Drag and drop the .fig file into the project folder in the browser UI. Figma will upload it, showing a new file card once complete.

## Publishing

To make PrimeOne available as a shared library: Open the imported PrimeOne .fig file. Go to Assets Manage Libraries Click "Publish..." to share PrimeOne with your team, then confirm by clicking the "Publish" button in the modal.

## C I Pipeline

Theme Designer offers an API that can be utilized to implement continuos integration pipelines to automate figma to theme code generation whenever you push updates to the repository from Figma. Visit the CI Pipeline documentation for comprehensive information.

## Design Changes

Change on Tokens Studio The first step when planning a design change is to identify which tokens need to be modified within Tokens Studio. Use the Inspect tab in Tokens Studio to locate the relevant tokens, then apply your changes directly via the plugin. After making the updates, don't forget to push the changes to your Sync Provider. Change on Figma Variables After making changes in Tokens Studio, you also need to apply these updates in Figma Variables. There are two options: Manually update the variables one by one, or Use the Export to Styles & Variables feature in Tokens Studio. In our own workflow, we prefer to update the variables manually, as the export feature can be unstable with large files like PrimeOne. We recommend this manual approach for reliability. However, if you choose to use the export feature, make sure the settings match the screenshot provided. Specifically, ensure the “ Themes (Pro) ” tab is selected during the second step. Don't worry, even though it says “Pro,” you don't need a Pro license to access this feature in Tokens Studio. If you notice missing or incomplete exports on your first attempt, try running the export again from the beginning. This is a known issue with Tokens Studio and often resolves on the second attempt. For more detailed guidance, see the official documentation . Get Updates on Consumer Files We do not recommend making design changes directly in consumer files, as this goes against best practices. Instead, apply all design updates in the main UI Kit file, then publish the library and accept the updates in any consumer files that rely on it.

## Tokens Studio Setup

Set sync provider via Tokens Studio - Figma plugins are limited to sharing a maximum of 100KB of data through their APIs. Because PrimeOne's token data exceeds this limit, using tokens locally within your Figma file may lead to performance issues. To avoid this, you should first configure and switch to a remote sync provider. You can follow the official Tokens Studio guide for setting up remote storage. Push tokens to your sync provider - Once you've successfully switched to your new sync provider, push the token data from your local file to the new provider to ensure everything stays in sync. Set Base Font Size to {app.font.size} in Tokens Studio Settings - PrimeOne uses a base font size of 14px, aligning with the default in Prime UI libraries. In Tokens Studio, go to the Settings tab and set the Base font size to {app.font.size} . If you wish to change this value, you can update the corresponding token in the app set.

# Accessibility

PrimeVue has WCAG 2.1 AA level compliance, refer to the accessibility documentation of each component for detailed information.

## Colors

Colors on a web page should aim a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 and consider a selection of colors that do not cause vibration. Good Contrast Color contrast between the background and the foreground content should be sufficient enough to ensure readability. Example below displays two cases with good and bad samples. GOOD BAD Vibration Color vibration is leads to an illusion of motion due to choosing colors that have low visibility against each other. Color combinations need to be picked with caution to avoid vibration. VIBRATE Dark Mode Highly saturated colors should be avoided when used within a dark design scheme as they cause eye strain. Instead desaturated colors should be preferred. Indigo 500 Indigo 200

## Form Controls

Native form elements should be preferred instead of elements that are meant for other purposes like presentation. As an example, button below is rendered as a form control by the browser, can receive focus via tabbing and can be used with space key as well to trigger.

```vue
<button @click="onButtonClick(event)">Click</button>

<div class="fancy-button" @click="onButtonClick(event)">Click</div>

<div class="fancy-button" @click="onClick(event)" @keydown="onKeyDown(event)" tabindex="0">Click</div>

<label for="myinput">Username:</label>
<input id="myinput" type="text" name="username" />
```

## Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world population has a disability to some degree. As a result, accessibility features in any context such as a ramp for wheelchair users or a multimedia with captions are crucial to ensure content can be consumed by anyone. Types of disabilities are diverse so you need to know your audience well and how they interact with the content created. There four main categories; Visual Impairments Blindness, low-level vision or color blindness are the common types of visual impairments. Screen magnifiers and the color blind mode are usually built-in features of the browsers whereas for people who rely on screen readers, page developers are required to make sure content is readable by the readers. Popular readers are NVDA , JAWS and ChromeVox . Hearing Impairments Deafness or hearing loss refers to the inability to hear sounds totally or partially. People with hearing impairments use assistive devices however it may not be enough when interacting with a web page. Common implementation is providing textual alternatives, transcripts and captions for content with audio. Mobility Impairments People with mobility impairments have disabilities related to movement due to loss of a limb, paralysis or other varying reasons. Assistive technologies like a head pointer is a device to interact with a screen whereas keyboard or a trackpad remain as solutions for people who are not able to utilize a mouse. Cognitive Impairments Cognitive impairments have a wider range that includes people with learning disabilities, depression and dyslexia. A well designed content also leads to better user experience for people without disabilities so designing for cognitive impairments result in better design for any user.

## Semantic HTML

HTML offers various element to organize content on a web page that screen readers are aware of. Preferring Semantic HTML for good semantics provide out of the box support for reader which is not possible when regular div elements with classes are used. Consider the following example that do not mean too much for readers.

```vue
<div class="header">
    <div class="header-text">Header</div>
</div>

<div class="nav"></div>

<div class="main">
    <div class="content">
    </div>

    <div class="sidebar">
    </div>
</div>

<div class="footer">
</div>

<header>
    <h1>Header</h1>
</header>

<nav></nav>

<main>
    <article></article>

    <aside></aside>
</main>

<footer>
</footer>
```

## WAI ARIA

ARIA refers to "Accessible Rich Internet Applications" is a suite to fill the gap where semantic HTML is inadequate. These cases are mainly related to rich UI components/widgets. Although browser support for rich UI components such as a datepicker or colorpicker has been improved over the past years many web developers still utilize UI components derived from standard HTML elements created by them or by other projects like PrimeVue. These types of components must provide keyboard and screen reader support, the latter case is where the WAI-ARIA is utilized. ARIA consists of roles, properties and attributes. Roles define what the element is mainly used for e.g. checkbox , dialog , tablist whereas States and Properties define the metadata of the element like aria-checked , aria-disabled . Consider the following case of a native checkbox. It has built-in keyboard and screen reader support.

## WCAG

Correct page structure with the aid of assistive technologies are the core ingridients for an accessible web content. HTML is based on an accessible foundation, form controls can be used by keyboard by default and semantic HTML is easier to be processed by a screen reader. WCAG refers to Web Content Accessibility Guideline , a standard managed by the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) of W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). WCAG consists of recommendations for making the web content more accessible. PrimeVue components aim high level of WCAG compliancy in the near future. Various countries around the globe have governmental policies regarding web accessibility as well. Most well known of these are Section 508 in the US and Web Accessibility Directive of the European Union.

# Animations

Various PrimeVue Components utilize native CSS animations to provide an enhanced user experience. The default animations are based on the best practices recommended by the usability experts. In case you need to customize the default animations, this documentation covers the entire set of built-in animations.

## Anchored Overlays

Anchored overlays are the components that have a floating ui positioned relatively to another element such as Select, Popover. The enter and leave animations are defined with the .p-anchored-overlay-enter-active and .p-anchored-overlay-leave-active classes.

```vue
.p-anchored-overlay-enter-active {
    animation: demo-overlay-in 300ms ease-out;
}

.p-anchored-overlay-leave-active {
    animation: demo-overlay-out 250ms ease-in;
}

@keyframes demo-overlay-in {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(10%);
    }
}

@keyframes demo-overlay-out {
    to {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(10%);
    }
}
```

## Collapsibles

Collapsible components have a content that is toggleable including Accordion, Panel, Fieldset, Stepper and PanelMenu. The enter and leave animations are defined with the .p-collapsible-enter-active and .p-collapsible-leave-active classes.

```vue
.p-collapsible-enter-active {
    animation: demo-collapsible-expand 500ms cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1);
}

.p-collapsible-leave-active {
    animation: demo-collapsible-collapse 500ms cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1);
}

@keyframes demo-collapsible-expand {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        grid-template-rows: 0fr;
        transform: scale(0.93);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    }
}

@keyframes demo-collapsible-collapse {
    from {
        opacity: 1;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 0;
        grid-template-rows: 0fr;
        transform: scale(0.93);
    }
}
```

## Dialog

Overlays such as Dialog and Drawer are positioned relative to the viewport and have their own animations.

```vue
.p-dialog-enter-active {
    animation: demo-dialog-in 500ms ease-out;
}

.p-dialog-leave-active {
    animation: demo-dialog-out 500ms ease-in;
}

@keyframes demo-dialog-in {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-10%) scale(1.1);
        filter: blur(10px);
    }
}

@keyframes demo-dialog-out {
    to {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(200%) rotate(-90deg);
    }
}
```

## Disable

Individual animations can be reduced and even disabled completely using the animation duration.

```vue
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    .p-anchored-overlay-enter-active,
    .p-anchored-overlay-leave-active {
        animation-duration: 0s !important;
    }
}
```

## Introduction

Various PrimeVue Components utilize native CSS animations to provide an enhanced user experience. The default animations are based on the best practices recommended by the usability experts. In case you need to customize the default animations, this documentation covers the entire set of built-in animations. Animations are defined using a combination of style classes and keyframes. The ⁠ .{classname}-enter-active and ⁠ .{classname}-leave-active classes specify the animation name, duration, and easing function. You can customize animations globally by overriding the default animation classes, affecting all components. Alternatively, you can apply scoped classes to individual components to modify their animations independently. For demo purposes, this second approach is used throughout the next sections.

# Dynamic Imports

Dynamic imports enable the loading of multiple items as needed, streamlining the import process.

## Overview

With @primevue/icons for icons and primevue for components (except Editor and Chart), multiple items can be imported together.

```vue
import { Button, InputText } from 'primevue';
import { SearchIcon, BellIcon } from '@primevue/icons';

<script setup>
import * as PrimeVue from 'primevue';

const items = [
    { as: 'Button', class: 'my-button-class' },
    { as: 'InputText', class: 'my-inputtext-class' }
};
</script>

<template>
    <component v-for="item of items" :is="PrimeVue[item.as]" :class="item.class" />
</template>
```

# Migration

Migration guide to PrimeVue v4.

## Overview

At PrimeTek, we have been developing UI component libraries since 2008. The web continues to undergo technological advancements, and as a result, we have to modernize and update our libraries to stay relevant. PrimeVue v4 is the next-generation version that fully embraces modern Web APIs and removes technical debt like the legacy-styled mode. Every component has been reviewed and enhanced. As part of our commitment to our products and the community, PrimeVue v3 will continue to be maintained until the end of 2024. The most notable feature is the new styled mode implementation. Previous iterations use SASS at an external repo called primevue-sass-theme which requires compilation of a theme.css a file. This file had to be included in the application and need to be swapped at runtime for basic tasks like dark mode or primary color changes. In v4, styled mode is now part of the core, SASS is not used at all, and a new design token based architecture that fully utilizes CSS variables has been created. The new API is modern and superior to the legacy styled mode. Names of some of the components have been changed to more common alternatives for example, Popover replaced OverlayPanel and InputSwitch is now called ToggleSwitch . Each component has been reviewed for a consistent naming between CSS class names and PT sections. An example would be the option element of a Select component that uses p-select-option for the class name. Components have been utilized more within other components, for instance Dialog close button is not actually a PrimeVue button so that closeButtonProps can be used to enable the features of button like outlined, raised and more. Whenever a component is using another component, in v3 the pt sections were causing confusion, to prevent this pc prefix is added to indicate that the PT section is actually a PrimeVue component, not a simple DOM element. This is especially useful because PT allows passing arbitrary attributes to DOM elements whereas if the element is actually a PrimeVue component, props can also be passed.

## Breaking

SASS Themes The styled mode theming has been reimplemented from scratch based on an all-new architecture. The theme.css and the primevue/resources do not exist anymore, so any imports of these assets needs to be removed. If you had a custom theme for v3, the theme needs to be recreated using the new APIs. See the customization section at styled mode for details. Removed Components TriStateCheckbox | Use Checkbox with indeterminate option. DataViewLayoutOptions | Use SelectButton instead. Removed APIs switchTheme function, use the new APIs like usePreset instead to dynamic theme switching. Relocated APIs Imports from primevue/api have been relocated to @primevue/core/api . Removed Files Themes under the primevue/resources path, migration to new styled mode is necessary. The legacy Tailwind preset at primevue/passthrough/tailwind , migrate to the Volt project if you'd like to style PrimeVue with Tailwind CSS. Message and InlineMessage InlineMessage is deprecated due to overlap with the Message . The spacing, closable and life properties of the Message have breaking changes to provide InlineMessage functionality. Default margin is removed, closable is false by default and messages do not disappear automatically. PT Section Names The experimental PassThrough feature is not production ready, there are changes on the PT section names due to alignment with CSS classes for certain components. If when component element is another PrimeVue component pc prefix is added for indication. Review the Pass Through section of a component for the new API. The Tailwind CSS presets for the unstyled mode are not updated to v4 yet. Removed Features Sidebar/Drawer size property is removed, use a responsive class utilty as replacement, demos have new examples. Rating cancel prop is removed as toggling the selected star value clears it. Inplace closable is removed in favor of templating and closeCallback prop. Removed Style Classes .p-link , use a button in link mode. .p-highlight , each component have its own class such as .p-select-option-selected . .p-fluid , use the new built-in fluid property of the supported components or the Fluid component. Nuxt Module The nuxt-primevue module has been replaced with the new @primevue/nuxt-module . The old module is still maintained for v3 users. PrimeFlex CSS In case you are using PrimeFlex CSS library, upgrade to PrimeFlex v4 since PrimeFlex v3 is not compatible with PrimeVue v4+.

## Compatible

Renamed Components Old names are deprecated but still functional, migrate to new import paths instead e.g. primevue/calendar becomes primevue/datepicker . Calendar -> DatePicker . Dropdown -> Select . InputSwitch -> ToggleSwitch . OverlayPanel -> Popover . Sidebar -> Drawer . Deprecated Components Components that are deprecated since their functionality is provided by other components. Chips | Use AutoComplete with multiple enabled and typeahead disabled. TabMenu | Use Tabs without panels. Steps | Use Stepper without panels. InlineMessage | Use Message component. BadgeDirective | Use OverlayBadge instead. TabView | Use the new Tabs components. Accordion | Use with the new AccordionHeader and AccordionContent components. Important Tickets Issue tickets with detailed information about component internal changes. #5426 #5437

# RTL Support

Right-to-left direction support of PrimeVue.

## Configuration

The PrimeVue components natively support Right-to-Left (RTL) text direction through a modern CSS implementation utilizing FlexBox and classes like *-inline-start and *-block-end . Consequently, no JavaScript configuration is necessary; setting the document's text direction to RTL is sufficient to enable this feature. The RTL setting can either be set using the dir attribute or with the direction style property.

```vue
<html dir="rtl">

html {
    direction: rtl
}
```

## Limitations

RTL is widely supported by the UI suite except the Galleria and Carousel components. These components will be enhanced with a modern implementation in upcoming versions with built-in support for RTL.

# Vue Accordion Component

Accordion groups a collection of contents in panels.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Accordion header elements is a button element and use aria-controls to define the id of the content section along with aria-expanded for the visibility state. The value to read a header element defaults to the value of the header property and can be customized by defining an aria-label or aria-labelledby via the pt property. The content uses region role, defines an id that matches the aria-controls of the header and aria-labelledby referring to the id of the header. Header Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Toggles the visibility of the content. space Toggles the visibility of the content. down arrow Moves focus to the next header. If focus is on the last header, moves focus to the first header. up arrow Moves focus to the previous header. If focus is on the first header, moves focus to the last header. home Moves focus to the first header. end Moves focus to the last header.

## Basic

Accordion is defined using AccordionPanel , AccordionHeader and AccordionContent components. Each AccordionPanel must contain a unique value property to specify the active item.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Accordion value="0">
    <AccordionPanel value="0">
        <AccordionHeader>Header I</AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionContent>
            <p class="m-0">
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
                consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
            </p>
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionPanel>
    <AccordionPanel value="1">
        <AccordionHeader>Header II</AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionContent>
            <p class="m-0">
                Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim
                ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi.
            </p>
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionPanel>
    <AccordionPanel value="2">
        <AccordionHeader>Header III</AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionContent>
            <p class="m-0">
                At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa
                qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus.
            </p>
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>
```

## Controlled

Panels can be controlled programmatically using value property as a model.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<div class="flex mb-4 gap-2 justify-end">
    <Button @click="active = '0'" rounded label="1" class="w-8 h-8 p-0" :outlined="active !== '0'" />
    <Button @click="active = '1'" rounded label="2" class="w-8 h-8 p-0" :outlined="active !== '1'" />
    <Button @click="active = '2'" rounded label="3" class="w-8 h-8 p-0" :outlined="active !== '2'" />
</div>

<Accordion v-model:value="active">
    <AccordionPanel value="0">

## Dynamic

AccordionPanel can be generated dynamically using the standard v-for directive.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Accordion value="0">
    <AccordionPanel v-for="tab in tabs" :key="tab.title" :value="tab.value">
        <AccordionHeader>{{ tab.title }}</AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionContent>
            <p class="m-0">{{ tab.content }}</p>
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <Accordion value="0">
            <AccordionPanel v-for="tab in tabs" :key="tab.title" :value="tab.value">
                <AccordionHeader>{{ tab.title }}</AccordionHeader>
                <AccordionContent>
                    <p class="m-0">{{ tab.content }}</p>
                </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionPanel>
        </Accordion>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const tabs = ref([
    { title: 'Title 1', content: 'Content 1', value: '0' },
    { title: 'Title 2', content: 'Content 2', value: '1' },
    { title: 'Title 3', content: 'Content 3', value: '2' }
]);
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Accordion from 'primevue/accordion';
import AccordionPanel from 'primevue/accordionpanel';
import AccordionHeader from 'primevue/accordionheader';
import AccordionContent from 'primevue/accordioncontent';
```

## Multiple

Only one tab at a time can be active by default, enabling multiple property changes this behavior to allow multiple panels. In this case value needs to be an array.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Accordion :value="['0']" multiple>
    <AccordionPanel value="0">
        <AccordionHeader>Header I</AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionContent>
            <p class="m-0">

## Template

Custom content for a header is defined with the default slot. The optional as property controls the default container element of a header, for example setting it to a div renders a div for the header instead of a button. The asChild option enables the headless mode for further customization by passing callbacks and properties to implement your own header.

**Basic Usage:**

# Vue AnimateOnScroll Directive

AnimateOnScroll is used to apply animations to elements when entering or leaving the viewport during scrolling.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader AnimateOnScroll does not require any roles and attributes. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## Basic

Animation classes are defined with the enterClass and leaveClass properties. This example utilizes tailwindcss-primeui plugin animations however any valid CSS animation is supported.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue

In multiple mode, chip list uses listbox role with aria-orientation set to horizontal whereas each chip has the option role with aria-label set to the label of the chip. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the input element and uses listbox as the role. Each list item has option role and an id to match the aria-activedescendant of the input element.

<AutoComplete v-model="selectedCountry" forceSelection optionLabel="name" :suggestions="filteredCountries" @complete="search" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

        <AutoComplete v-model="selectedCountry" forceSelection optionLabel="name" :suggestions="filteredCountries" @complete="search" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
import { CountryService } from "@/service/CountryService";

onMounted(() => {
    CountryService.getCountries().then((data) => (countries.value = data));
});

const countries = ref();
const selectedCountry = ref();
const filteredCountries = ref();


const search = (event) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!event.query.trim().length) {
            filteredCountries.value = [...countries.value];
        } else {
            filteredCountries.value = countries.value.filter((country) => {
                return country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(event.query.toLowerCase());
            });
        }
    }, 250);
}
<\/script>
```

## Ifta Label

IftaLabel is used to create infield top aligned labels. Visit IftaLabel documentation for more information.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<IftaLabel>
    <AutoComplete v-model="value" inputId="ac" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" variant="filled" />
    <label for="ac">Identifier</label>
</IftaLabel>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <IftaLabel>
            <AutoComplete v-model="value" inputId="ac" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" variant="filled" />
            <label for="ac">Identifier</label>
        </IftaLabel>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const value = ref(null);
const items = ref([]);

const search = (event) => {
    items.value = [...Array(10).keys()].map((item) => event.query + '-' + item);
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import AutoComplete from 'primevue/autocomplete';
```

## Invalid

Invalid state is displayed using the invalid prop to indicate a failed validation. You can use this style when integrating with form validation libraries.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AutoComplete v-model="value1" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" :invalid="!value1" placeholder="Code" />
<AutoComplete v-model="value2" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" :invalid="!value2" variant="filled" placeholder="Code" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4">
        <AutoComplete v-model="value1" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" :invalid="!value1" placeholder="Code" />
        <AutoComplete v-model="value2" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" :invalid="!value2" variant="filled" placeholder="Code" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const value1 = ref('');
const value2 = ref('');
const items = ref([]);

const search = (event) => {
    items.value = [...Array(10).keys()].map((item) => event.query + '-' + item);
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Multiple

Multiple mode is enabled using multiple property used to select more than one value from the autocomplete. In this case, value reference should be an array.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<label for="multiple-ac-1" class="font-bold mb-2 block">With Typeahead</label>
<AutoComplete v-model="value1" inputId="multiple-ac-1" multiple fluid :suggestions="items" @complete="search" />

<label for="multiple-ac-2" class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2 block">Without Typeahead</label>
<AutoComplete v-model="value2" inputId="multiple-ac-2" multiple fluid @complete="search" :typeahead="false" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <label for="multiple-ac-1" class="font-bold mb-2 block">With Typeahead</label>
        <AutoComplete v-model="value1" inputId="multiple-ac-1" multiple fluid :suggestions="items" @complete="search" />

        <label for="multiple-ac-2" class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2 block">Without Typeahead</label>
        <AutoComplete v-model="value2" inputId="multiple-ac-2" multiple fluid @complete="search" :typeahead="false" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const value1 = ref(null);
const value2 = ref(null);
const items = ref([]);

const search = (event) => {
    items.value = [...Array(10).keys()].map((item) => event.query + '-' + item);
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Objects

AutoComplete can work with objects using the optionLabel property that defines the label to display as a suggestion. The value passed to the model would still be the object instance of a suggestion. Here is an example with a Country object that has name and code fields such as &#123;name: "United States", code:"USA"&#125; .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AutoComplete v-model="selectedCountry" optionLabel="name" :suggestions="filteredCountries" @complete="search" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <AutoComplete v-model="selectedCountry" optionLabel="name" :suggestions="filteredCountries" @complete="search" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
import { CountryService } from "@/service/CountryService";

onMounted(() => {
    CountryService.getCountries().then((data) => (countries.value = data));
});

const countries = ref();
const selectedCountry = ref();
const filteredCountries = ref();


const search = (event) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!event.query.trim().length) {
            filteredCountries.value = [...countries.value];
        } else {
            filteredCountries.value = countries.value.filter((country) => {
                return country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(event.query.toLowerCase());
            });
        }
    }, 250);
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Sizes

AutoComplete provides small and large sizes as alternatives to the base.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AutoComplete v-model="value1" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" size="small" placeholder="Small" dropdown />
<AutoComplete v-model="value2" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" placeholder="Normal" dropdown />
<AutoComplete v-model="value3" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" size="large" placeholder="Large" dropdown />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
        <AutoComplete v-model="value1" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" size="small" placeholder="Small" dropdown />
        <AutoComplete v-model="value2" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" placeholder="Normal" dropdown />
        <AutoComplete v-model="value3" :suggestions="items" @complete="search" size="large" placeholder="Large" dropdown />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const value1 = ref(null);
const value2 = ref(null);
const value3 = ref(null);
const items = ref([]);

const search = () => {
    items.value = [];
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Template

AutoComplete offers multiple slots for customization through templating.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AutoComplete v-model="selectedCountry" optionLabel="name" :suggestions="filteredCountries" @complete="search">
    <template #option="slotProps">
        <div class="flex items-center">
            <img :alt="slotProps.option.name" src="https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/flag/flag_placeholder.png" :class="\`flag flag-\${slotProps.option.code.toLowerCase()} mr-2\`" style="width: 18px" />
            <div>{{ slotProps.option.name }}</div>
        </div>
    </template>
    <template #header>
        <div class="font-medium px-3 py-2">Available Countries</div>

            filteredCountries.value = [...countries.value];
        } else {
            filteredCountries.value = countries.value.filter((country) => {
                return country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(event.query.toLowerCase());

## Virtual Scroll

Virtual Scrolling is a performant way to render large lists. Configuration of the scroll behavior is defined with virtualScrollerOptions that requires itemSize as the mandatory value to set the height of an item. Visit VirtualScroller documentation for more information about the configuration API.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AutoComplete v-model="selectedItem" :suggestions="filteredItems" @complete="searchItems"
    :virtualScrollerOptions="{ itemSize: 38 }" optionLabel="label" dropdown />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const items = ref(Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => ({ label: \`Item #\${i}\`, value: i })));
const selectedItem = ref();
const filteredItems = ref();
const searchItems = (event) => {
    //in a real application, make a request to a remote url with the query and return filtered results, for demo we filter at client side
    let query = event.query;
    let _filteredItems = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < items.value.length; i++) {
        let item = items.value[i];

        if (item.label.toLowerCase().indexOf(query.toLowerCase()) === 0) {
            _filteredItems.push(item);
        }
    }

# Vue Avatar Component

Avatar represents people using icons, labels and images.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Avatar does not include any roles and attributes by default. Any attribute is passed to the root element so you may add a role like img along with aria-labelledby or aria-label to describe the component. In case avatars need to be tabbable, tabindex can be added as well to implement custom key handlers. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## AvatarGroup

Grouping is available by wrapping multiple Avatar components inside an AvatarGroup.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<AvatarGroup>
    <Avatar image="/images/avatar/amyelsner.png" shape="circle" />
    <Avatar image="/images/avatar/asiyajavayant.png" shape="circle" />
    <Avatar image="/images/avatar/onyamalimba.png" shape="circle" />

    <template #item="slotProps">
        <div class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded m-2  p-4">
            <div class="mb-4">
                <div class="relative mx-auto">
                    <img :src="'https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/product/' + slotProps.data.image" :alt="slotProps.data.name" class="w-full rounded" />
                    <Tag :value="slotProps.data.inventoryStatus" :severity="getSeverity(slotProps.data.inventoryStatus)" class="absolute" style="left:5px; top: 5px"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4 font-medium">{{ slotProps.data.name }}</div>
            <div class="flex justify-between items-center">
                <div class="mt-0 font-semibold text-xl">\${{ slotProps.data.price }}</div>
                <span>
                    <Button icon="pi pi-heart" severity="secondary" variant="outlined" />
                    <Button icon="pi pi-shopping-cart" class="ml-2"/>
                </span>

                    <img :src="'https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/product/' + slotProps.data.image" :alt="slotProps.data.name" class="w-full rounded" />
                    <Tag :value="slotProps.data.inventoryStatus" :severity="getSeverity(slotProps.data.inventoryStatus)" class="absolute" style="left:5px; top: 5px"/>
                </div>

    rating: 5
},
...
```

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Carousel from 'primevue/carousel';
```

## Responsive

Carousel supports specific configuration per screen size with the responsiveOptions property that takes an array of objects where each object defines the max-width breakpoint , numVisible for the number of items items per page and numScroll for number of items to scroll. When responsiveOptions is defined, the numScroll and numVisible properties of the Carousel are used as default when there is breakpoint that applies.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Carousel :value="products" :numVisible="3" :numScroll="1" :responsiveOptions="responsiveOptions">
    <template #item="slotProps">
        <div class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded m-2  p-4">

                    <Tag :value="slotProps.data.inventoryStatus" :severity="getSeverity(slotProps.data.inventoryStatus)" class="absolute" style="left:5px; top: 5px"/>
                </div>

# Vue CascadeSelect Component

CascadeSelect is a form component to select a value from a nested structure of options.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The cascadeselect element has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls that refers to the id of the popup. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the combobox element and uses tree as the role. Each list item has a treeitem role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-expanded attributes. The container element of a treenode has the group role. The aria-setsize , aria-posinset and aria-level attributes are calculated implicitly and added to each treeitem. Closed State Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the cascadeselect element. space Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. enter Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. down arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. up arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then last option receives the focus. any printable character Opens the popup and moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed, if there is none then first option receives the focus. Popup Keyboard Support Key Function tab Hides the popup and moves focus to the next tabbable element. If there is none, the focusable option is selected and the overlay is closed then moves focus to next element in page. shift + tab Hides the popup and moves focus to the previous tabbable element. enter Selects the focused option and closes the popup. space Selects the focused option and closes the popup. escape Closes the popup, moves focus to the cascadeselect element. down arrow Moves focus to the next option. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option. alt + up arrow Selects the focused option and closes the popup, then moves focus to the cascadeselect element. right arrow If option is closed, opens the option otherwise moves focus to the first child option. left arrow If option is open, closes the option otherwise moves focus to the parent option. home Moves input cursor at the end, if not then moves focus to the first option. end Moves input cursor at the beginning, if not then moves focus to the last option. any printable character Moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="dd1"></span>Options</span>
<CascadeSelect aria-labelledby="dd1" />

<CascadeSelect aria-label="Options" />
```

## Basic

CascadeSelect is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. To define the label of a group optionGroupLabel property is needed and also optionGroupChildren is required to define the property that refers to the children of a group. Note that order of the optionGroupChildren matters as it should correspond to the data hierarchy.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<CascadeSelect v-model="selectedCity" :options="countries" optionLabel="cname" optionGroupLabel="name"
    :optionGroupChildren="['states', 'cities']" class="w-56" placeholder="Select a City" />
```

## Clear Icon

When showClear is enabled, a clear icon is added to reset the CascadeSelect.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<CascadeSelect v-model="selectedCity" :options="countries" optionLabel="cname" optionGroupLabel="name"
    :optionGroupChildren="['states', 'cities']" class="w-56" placeholder="Select a City" />
```

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <CascadeSelect name="city" :options="countries" optionLabel="cname" optionGroupLabel="name" :optionGroupChildren="['states', 'cities']" class="w-56" placeholder="Select a City" />
        <Message v-if="$form.city?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.city.error?.message }}</Message>

# Vue Chart Component

Chart components are based on Chart.js, an open source HTML5 based charting library.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Chart components internally use canvas element, refer to the Chart.js accessibility guide for more information. The canvas element can be customized with canvasProps property to define aria roles and properties, in addition any content inside the component is directly passed as a child of the canvas to be able to provide fallback content like a table.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Chart type="line" :data="data" :canvasProps="{'role': 'img', 'aria-label': 'Data'}" />
```

## Basic

A chart is configured with 3 properties; type , data and options . Chart type is defined using the type property that accepts pie , doughnut , line , bar , radar and polarArea as a value. The data defines datasets represented with the chart and the options provide numerous customization options to customize the presentation.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Chart type="bar" :data="chartData" :options="chartOptions" />
```

## Chart.js

Chart component uses Chart.JS underneath so it needs to be installed as a dependency.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
npm install chart.js
```

## Combo

Different chart types can be combined in the same graph usign the type option of a dataset.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Chart type="bar" :data="chartData" :options="chartOptions" class="h-[30rem]" />
```

# Vue Confirmation Dialog Component

ConfirmDialog uses a Dialog UI that is integrated with the Confirmation API.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader ConfirmDialog component uses alertdialog role along with aria-labelledby referring to the header element however any attribute is passed to the root element so you may use aria-labelledby to override this default behavior. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup. When require method of the $confirm instance is used and a trigger is passed as a parameter, ConfirmDialog adds aria-expanded state attribute and aria-controls to the trigger so that the relation between the trigger and the dialog is defined. Overlay Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the dialog. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the dialog. escape Closes the dialog. Buttons Keyboard Support Key Function enter Closes the dialog. space Closes the dialog.

## Basic

ConfirmDialog is displayed by calling the require method of the $confirm instance by passing the options to customize the Dialog. The target attribute is mandatory to align the popup to its referrer.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<ConfirmDialog></ConfirmDialog>
<Button @click="confirm1()" label="Save" variant="outlined"></Button>
<Button @click="confirm2()" label="Delete" severity="danger" variant="outlined"></Button>
```

## ConfirmationServiceDoc

ConfirmDialog is controlled via the ConfirmationService that needs to be installed as an application plugin.

## Headless

Headless mode is enabled by defining a container slot that lets you implement entire confirmation UI instead of the default elements.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<ConfirmDialog group="headless">
    <template #container="{ message, acceptCallback, rejectCallback }">
        <div class="flex flex-col items-center p-8 bg-surface-0 dark:bg-surface-900 rounded">
            <div class="rounded-full bg-primary text-primary-contrast inline-flex justify-center items-center h-24 w-24 -mt-20">
                <i class="pi pi-question !text-4xl"></i>
            </div>
            <span class="font-bold text-2xl block mb-2 mt-6">{{ message.header }}</span>
            <p class="mb-0">{{ message.message }}</p>
            <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mt-6">
                <Button label="Save" @click="acceptCallback" class="w-32"></Button>

# Vue ContextMenu Component

ContextMenu displays an overlay menu to display actions related to an element.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader ContextMenu component uses the menubar role with aria-orientation set to "vertical" and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. Each list item has a menuitem role with aria-label referring to the label of the item and aria-disabled defined if the item is disabled. A submenu within a ContextMenu uses the menu role with an aria-labelledby defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, menuitems that open a submenu have aria-haspopup and aria-expanded to define the relation between the item and the submenu. Keyboard Support Key Function tab When focus is in the menu, closes the context menu and moves focus to the next focusable element in the page sequence. enter If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. space If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. escape Closes the context menu. down arrow If focus is not inside the menu and menu is open, add focus to the first item. If an item is already focused, moves focus to the next menuitem within the submenu. up arrow If focus is not inside the menu and menu is open, add focus to the last item. If an item is already focused, moves focus to the next menuitem within the submenu. right arrow Opens a submenu if there is one available and moves focus to the first item. left arrow Closes a submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu. home Moves focus to the first menuitem within the submenu. end Moves focus to the last menuitem within the submenu. any printable character Moves focus to the menuitem whose label starts with the characters being typed.

## Basic

ContextMenu requires a collection of menuitems as its model and the show method needs to be called explicity using an event of the target like contextmenu to display the menu.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<img alt="Logo" src="/images/nature/nature2.jpg" class="w-full md:w-[30rem] rounded shadow-lg" @contextmenu="onImageRightClick" aria-haspopup="true" />
<ContextMenu ref="menu" :model="items" />
```

## Command

The command property defines the callback to run when an item is activated by click or a key event.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<ul class="m-0 list-none border border-surface rounded p-4 flex flex-col gap-2 w-full sm:w-96">
    <li
        v-for="user in users"
        :key="user.id"
        :class="['p-2 hover:bg-emphasis rounded border border-transparent transition-all duration-200 flex items-center justify-content-between', { 'border-primary': selectedUser?.id === user.id }]"
        @contextmenu="onRightClick($event, user)"
    >
        <div class="flex flex-1 items-center gap-2">
            <img :alt="user.name" :src="\`https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/avatar/\${user.image}\`" class="w-8 h-8" />
            <span class="font-bold">{{ user.name }}</span>
        </div>
        <Tag :value="user.role" :severity="getBadge(user)" />
    </li>
</ul>
<ContextMenu ref="menu" :model="items" @hide="selectedUser = null" />
<Toast />

Screen Reader DataTable uses a table element whose attributes can be extended with the tableProps option. This property allows passing aria roles and attributes like aria-label and aria-describedby to define the table for readers. Default role of the table is table . Header, body and footer elements use rowgroup , rows use row role, header cells have columnheader and body cells use cell roles. Sortable headers utilizer aria-sort attribute either set to "ascending" or "descending". Built-in checkbox and radiobutton components for row selection use checkbox and radiobutton . The label to describe them is retrieved from the aria.selectRow and aria.unselectRow properties of the locale API. Similarly header checkbox uses selectAll and unselectAll keys. When a row is selected, aria-selected is set to true on a row. The element to expand or collapse a row is a button with aria-expanded and aria-controls properties. Value to describe the buttons is derived from aria.expandRow and aria.collapseRow properties of the locale API. The filter menu button use aria.showFilterMenu and aria.hideFilterMenu properties as aria-label in addition to the aria-haspopup , aria-expanded and aria-controls to define the relation between the button and the overlay. Popop menu has dialog role with aria-modal as focus is kept within the overlay. The operator dropdown use aria.filterOperator and filter constraints dropdown use aria.filterConstraint properties. Buttons to add rules on the other hand utilize aria.addRule and aria.removeRule properties. The footer buttons similarly use aria.clear and aria.apply properties. filterInputProps of the Column component can be used to define aria labels for the built-in filter components, if a custom component is used with templating you also may define your own aria labels as well. Editable cells use custom templating so you need to manage aria roles and attributes manually if required. The row editor controls are button elements with aria.editRow , aria.cancelEdit and aria.saveEdit used for the aria-label . Paginator is a standalone component used inside the DataTable, refer to the paginator for more information about the accessibility features. Keyboard Support Any button element inside the DataTable used for cases like filter, row expansion, edit are tabbable and can be used with space and enter keys. Sortable Headers Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the headers. enter Sorts the column. space Sorts the column. Filter Menu Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the elements inside the popup. escape Hides the popup. Selection Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected row, if there is none then first row receives the focus. up arrow Moves focus to the previous row. down arrow Moves focus to the next row. enter Toggles the selected state of the focused row depending on the metaKeySelection setting. space Toggles the selected state of the focused row depending on the metaKeySelection setting. home Moves focus to the first row. end Moves focus to the last row. shift + down arrow Moves focus to the next row and toggles the selection state. shift + up arrow Moves focus to the previous row and toggles the selection state. shift + space Selects the rows between the most recently selected row and the focused row. control + shift + home Selects the focused rows and all the options up to the first one. control + shift + end Selects the focused rows and all the options down to the last one. control + a Selects all rows.

## Basic

DataTable requires a value as data to display and Column components as children for the representation.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataTable :value="products" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column field="code" header="Code"></Column>
    <Column field="name" header="Name"></Column>
    <Column field="category" header="Category"></Column>
    <Column field="quantity" header="Quantity"></Column>
</DataTable>
```

**Sample Data:**

```json
{
    id: '1000',
    code: 'f230fh0g3',
    name: 'Bamboo Watch',
    description: 'Product Description',
    image: 'bamboo-watch.jpg',
    price: 65,
    category: 'Accessories',
    quantity: 24,
    inventoryStatus: 'INSTOCK',
    rating: 5
},
...
```

## ColumnGroupDoc

Columns can be grouped within a Row component and groups can be displayed within a ColumnGroup component. These groups can be displayed using type property that can be header or footer . Number of cells and rows to span are defined with the colspan and rowspan properties of a Column.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataTable :value="sales" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <ColumnGroup type="header">
        <Row>
            <Column header="Product" :rowspan="3" />
            <Column header="Sale Rate" :colspan="4" />
        </Row>
        <Row>
            <Column header="Sales" :colspan="2" />
            <Column header="Profits" :colspan="2" />
        </Row>
        <Row>
            <Column header="Last Year" sortable field="lastYearSale" />
            <Column header="This Year" sortable field="thisYearSale" />
            <Column header="Last Year" sortable field="lastYearProfit" />
            <Column header="This Year" sortable field="thisYearProfit" />
        </Row>
    </ColumnGroup>
    <Column field="product" />
    <Column field="lastYearSale">
        <template #body="slotProps"> {{ slotProps.data.lastYearSale }}% </template>
    </Column>
    <Column field="thisYearSale">
        <template #body="slotProps"> {{ slotProps.data.thisYearSale }}% </template>
    </Column>
    <Column field="lastYearProfit">
        <template #body="slotProps">
            {{ formatCurrency(slotProps.data.lastYearProfit) }}
        </template>
    </Column>
    <Column field="thisYearProfit">
        <template #body="slotProps">
            {{ formatCurrency(slotProps.data.thisYearProfit) }}
        </template>
    </Column>
    <ColumnGroup type="footer">
        <Row>
            <Column footer="Totals:" :colspan="3" footerStyle="text-align:right" />
            <Column :footer="lastYearTotal" />
            <Column :footer="thisYearTotal" />
        </Row>
    </ColumnGroup>

import Row from 'primevue/row';                   // optional
```

## LazyLoadDoc

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets, instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data is loaded by invoking corresponding callbacks everytime paging , sorting and filtering occurs. Sample below imitates lazy loading data from a remote datasource using an in-memory list and timeouts to mimic network connection. Enabling the lazy property and assigning the logical number of rows to totalRecords by doing a projection query are the key elements of the implementation so that paginator displays the UI assuming there are actually records of totalRecords size although in reality they are not present on page, only the records that are displayed on the current page exist. Note that, the implementation of checkbox selection in lazy mode needs to be handled manually as in this example since the DataTable cannot know about the whole dataset.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataTable :value="customers" lazy paginator :first="first" :rows="10" v-model:filters="filters" ref="dt" dataKey="id"
        :totalRecords="totalRecords" :loading="loading" @page="onPage($event)" @sort="onSort($event)" @filter="onFilter($event)" filterDisplay="row"
        :globalFilterFields="['name','country.name', 'company', 'representative.name']"
        v-model:selection="selectedCustomers" :selectAll="selectAll" @select-all-change="onSelectAllChange" @row-select="onRowSelect" @row-unselect="onRowUnselect" tableStyle="min-width: 75rem">

        </template>
    </Column>
    <Column field="country.name" header="Country" filterField="country.name" filterMatchMode="contains" sortable>
        <template #body="{ data }">
            <div class="flex items-center gap-2">

## ReorderDoc

Order of the columns and rows can be changed using drag and drop. Column reordering is configured by adding reorderableColumns property. Similarly, adding rowReorder property to a column enables draggable rows. For the drag handle a column needs to have rowReorder property and table needs to have row-reorder event is required to control the state of the rows after reorder completes.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataTable :value="products" :reorderableColumns="true" @columnReorder="onColReorder" @rowReorder="onRowReorder" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column rowReorder headerStyle="width: 3rem" :reorderableColumn="false" />
    <Column v-for="col of columns" :field="col.field" :header="col.header" :key="col.field"></Column>
</DataTable>
```

## RowExpansionDoc

Row expansion is controlled with expandedRows property. The column that has the expander element requires expander property to be enabled. Optional rowExpand and rowCollapse events are available as callbacks. Expanded rows can either be an array of row data or when dataKey is present, an object whose keys are strings referring to the identifier of the row data and values are booleans to represent the expansion state e.g. &#123;'1004': true&#125; . The dataKey alternative is more performant for large amounts of data.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataTable v-model:expandedRows="expandedRows" :value="products" dataKey="id"
        @rowExpand="onRowExpand" @rowCollapse="onRowCollapse" tableStyle="min-width: 60rem">
    <template #header>
        <div class="flex flex-wrap justify-end gap-2">

## Size

In addition to a regular table, alternatives with alternative sizes are available.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<SelectButton v-model="size" :options="sizeOptions" optionLabel="label" dataKey="label" />
<DataTable :value="products" :size="size.value" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column field="code" header="Code"></Column>
    <Column field="name" header="Name"></Column>
    <Column field="category" header="Category"></Column>
    <Column field="quantity" header="Quantity"></Column>

## StatefulDoc

Stateful table allows keeping the state such as page, sort and filtering either at local storage or session storage so that when the page is visited again, table would render the data using the last settings. Change the state of the table e.g paginate, navigate away and then return to this table again to test this feature, the setting is set as session with the stateStorage property so that Table retains the state until the browser is closed. Other alternative is local referring to localStorage for an extended lifetime.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue

    stateStorage="session" stateKey="dt-state-demo-session" paginator :rows="5" filterDisplay="menu"

# Vue DataView Component

DataView displays data in grid or list layout with pagination and sorting features.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader The container element that wraps the layout options buttons has a group role whereas each button element uses button role and aria-pressed is updated depending on selection state. Values to describe the buttons are derived from the aria.listView and aria.gridView properties of the locale API respectively. Refer to paginator accessibility documentation for the paginator of the component. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the buttons. space Toggles the checked state of a button.

## Basic

DataView requires a value to display along with a list slot for item content.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataView :value="products">
    <template #list="slotProps">
        <div class="flex flex-col">
            <div v-for="(item, index) in slotProps.items" :key="index">
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center p-6 gap-4" :class="{ 'border-t border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700': index !== 0 }">
                    <div class="md:w-40 relative">

**Sample Data:**

```json
/* ProductService */
{
    id: '1000',
    code: 'f230fh0g3',
    name: 'Bamboo Watch',
    description: 'Product Description',
    image: 'bamboo-watch.jpg',
    price: 65,
    category: 'Accessories',
    quantity: 24,
    inventoryStatus: 'INSTOCK',
    rating: 5
},
...
```

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import DataView from 'primevue/dataview';
```

## Layout

DataView supports list and grid display modes defined with the layout property. The grid mode is not built-in for flexibility purposes and requires a library with CSS grid features like Tailwind.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataView :value="products" :layout="layout">
    <template #header>
        <div class="flex justify-end">
            <SelectButton v-model="layout" :options="options" :allowEmpty="false">
                <template #option="{ option }">
                    <i :class="[option === 'list' ? 'pi pi-bars' : 'pi pi-table']" />
                </template>
            </SelectButton>
        </div>
    </template>

    <template #list="slotProps">

## Sorting

Built-in sorting is controlled by bindings sortField and sortField properties from a custom UI.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DataView :value="products" :sortOrder="sortOrder" :sortField="sortField">
    <template #header>
        <Select v-model="sortKey" :options="sortOptions" optionLabel="label" placeholder="Sort By Price" @change="onSortChange($event)" />
    </template>

Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DeferredContent role="region" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Content loaded after page scrolled down">
    Content
</DeferredContent>
```

## Basic

DeferredContent is used by wrapping the target.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<DeferredContent @load="onImageLoad">
    <img src="/images/nature/nature4.jpg" alt="Nature" class="rounded-xl w-full md:w-96 block sm:mx-auto" />
</DeferredContent>
```

## DataTable

```vue
<DeferredContent @load="onDataLoad" role="region" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Content loaded after page scrolled down">
    <DataTable :value="products">
        <Column field="code" header="Code"></Column>
        <Column field="name" header="Name"></Column>

## Responsive

Dialog width can be adjusted per screen size with the breakpoints option where the max-width for the breakpoint and the width are defined as key-value pairs. When no breakpoint matches width defined in style or class is used. Alternatively responsive utility classes of libraries like Tailwind can also be used such as md:w-screen .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button label="Show" @click="visible = true" />

<Dialog v-model:visible="visible" modal header="Header" :style="{ width: '50vw' }" :breakpoints="{ '1199px': '75vw', '575px': '90vw' }">

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Drawer component uses complementary role by default, since any attribute is passed to the root element aria role can be changed depending on your use case and additional attributes like aria-labelledby can be added. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the drawer when opened. Trigger element also requires aria-expanded and aria-controls to be handled explicitly. Overlay Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the drawer. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the drawer. escape Closes the drawer. Close Button Keyboard Support Key Function enter Closes the drawer. space Closes the drawer.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button label="Show" icon="pi pi-external-link" @click="visible = true" :aria-controls="visible ? 'sbar' : null" :aria-expanded="visible"/>

<Drawer id="sbar" v-model:visible="visible" role="region" >
    <p>Content</p>
</Drawer>
```

# Vue Dynamic Dialog Component

Dialogs can be created dynamically with any component as the content using a DialogService.

## Accessibility

Visit accessibility section of dialog component for more information.

## CloseDialogDoc

The close function is available through a dialogRef that is injected to the component loaded by the dialog.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import { inject } from "vue";

const dialogRef = inject('dialogRef');

const closeDialog = () => {
    dialogRef.value.close();
}
```

## Customization

DynamicDialog uses the Dialog component internally, visit dialog for more information about the available props.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import ProductListDemo from './ProductListDemo';
import { useDialog } from 'primevue/usedialog';

const dialog = useDialog();

const showProducts = () => {
    dialog.open(ProductListDemo, {
        props: {
            header: 'Product List',
            style: {
                width: '50vw',
            },
            breakpoints:{
                '960px': '75vw',
                '640px': '90vw'
            },
            modal: true
        }
    });
}
```

## Dialog Service

A single shared dialog instance is required in the application, ideal location would be defining it once at the main application template. A dynamic dialog is controlled via the DialogService that needs to be installed as an application plugin. The service is available with the useDialog function for Composition API or using the $dialog property of the application for Options API.

## Events

The emits object defines callbacks to handle events emitted by the component within the Dialog.

## Example

A sample implementation to demonstrate loading components asynchronously, nested content and passing data.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button label="Select a Product" icon="pi pi-search" @click="showProducts" />

<DynamicDialog />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <Button label="Select a Product" icon="pi pi-search" @click="showProducts" />
        <Toast />
        <DynamicDialog />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { markRaw, defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue';
import { useDialog } from 'primevue/usedialog';
import { useToast } from 'primevue/usetoast';
import Button from 'primevue/button';
const ProductListDemo = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./components/ProductListDemo.vue'));
const FooterDemo = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./components/FooterDemo.vue'));

const dialog = useDialog();
const toast = useToast();

const showProducts = () => {
    const dialogRef = dialog.open(ProductListDemo, {
        props: {
            header: 'Product List',
            style: {
                width: '50vw',
            },
            breakpoints:{
                '960px': '75vw',
                '640px': '90vw'
            },
            modal: true
        },
        templates: {
            footer: markRaw(FooterDemo)
        },
        onClose: (options) => {
            const data = options.data;
            if (data) {
                const buttonType = data.buttonType;
                const summary_and_detail = buttonType ? { summary: 'No Product Selected', detail: \`Pressed '\${buttonType}' button\` } : { summary: 'Product Selected', detail: data.name };

                toast.add({ severity:'info', ...summary_and_detail, life: 3000 });
            }
        }
    });
}
<\/script>
```
</details>

**Sample Data:**

```json
/* ProductService */
{
    id: '1000',
    code: 'f230fh0g3',
    name: 'Bamboo Watch',
    description: 'Product Description',
    image: 'bamboo-watch.jpg',
    price: 65,
    category: 'Accessories',
    quantity: 24,
    inventoryStatus: 'INSTOCK',
    rating: 5
},
...
```

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import DynamicDialog from 'primevue/dynamicdialog';
```

## OpenDialogDoc

The open function of the DialogService is used to open a Dialog. First parameter is the component to load and second one is the configuration object to customize the Dialog. The component can also be loaded asynchronously, this approach is useful in conditional cases and to improve initial load times as well.

## Passing Data

Use the data property to pass parameters when opening a Dialog, the internal component can later access this data using dialogRef . Similarly when hiding a Dialog, any parameter passed to the close function is received from the onClose callback.

## Dynamic Dialog

### Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| unstyled | boolean | false | When enabled, it removes component related styles in the core. |

# Vue Editor Component

Editor is rich text editor component based on Quill.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Quill performs generally well in terms of accessibility. The elements in the toolbar can be tabbed and have the necessary ARIA roles/attributes for screen readers. One known limitation is the lack of arrow key support for dropdowns in the toolbar that may be overcome with a custom toolbar.

## Basic

Editor is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Editor v-model="value" editorStyle="height: 320px" />
```

## Forms

Editor integrates seamlessly with the PrimeVue Forms library.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Form v-slot="$form" :resolver="resolver" :initialValues="initialValues" @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <Editor name="content" editorStyle="height: 320px" />
        <Message v-if="$form.content?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.content.error?.message }}</Message>
    </div>
    <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
</Form>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <Form v-slot="$form" :resolver="resolver" :initialValues="initialValues" @submit="onFormSubmit" class="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
                <Editor name="content" editorStyle="height: 320px" />
                <Message v-if="$form.content?.invalid" severity="error" size="small" variant="simple">{{ $form.content.error?.message }}</Message>
            </div>
            <Button type="submit" severity="secondary" label="Submit" />
        </Form>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { zodResolver } from '@primevue/forms/resolvers/zod';
import { useToast } from "primevue/usetoast";
import { z } from 'zod';

const toast = useToast();
const initialValues = ref({
    content: ''
});
const resolver = ref(zodResolver(
    z.object({
        content: z.string().min(1, { message: 'Content is required.' })
    })
));

const onFormSubmit = ({ valid }) => {
    if (valid) {
        toast.add({ severity: 'success', summary: 'Form is submitted.', life: 3000 });
    }
};
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Editor from 'primevue/editor';
```

## Quill

Editor uses Quill editor underneath so it needs to be installed as a dependency.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
npm install quill
```

## ReadOnly

When readonly is present, the value cannot be edited.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Editor v-model="value" editorStyle="height: 320px" readonly />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <Editor v-model="value" editorStyle="height: 320px" readonly />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const value = ref('Always bet on Prime');
<\/script>
```
</details>

# Vue Fieldset Component

Fieldset is a grouping component with a content toggle feature.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Fieldset component uses the semantic fieldset element. When toggleable option is enabled, a button element is included inside the legend element, this button has aria-controls to define the id of the content section along with aria-expanded for the visibility state. The value to read the button defaults to the value of the legend property and can be customized by defining an aria-label or aria-labelledby via the toggleButtonProps property. The content uses region , defines an id that matches the aria-controls of the content toggle button and aria-labelledby referring to the id of the header. Content Toggle Button Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Toggles the visibility of the content. space Toggles the visibility of the content.

## Basic

A simple Fieldset is created with a legend property along with the content as children.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Fieldset legend="Header">

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<FileUpload name="demo[]" url="/api/upload" @upload="onAdvancedUpload($event)" :multiple="true" accept="image/*" :maxFileSize="1000000">
    <template #empty>
        <span>Drag and drop files to here to upload.</span>
    </template>
</FileUpload>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <Toast />
        <FileUpload name="demo[]" url="/api/upload" @upload="onAdvancedUpload($event)" :multiple="true" accept="image/*" :maxFileSize="1000000">
            <template #empty>
                <span>Drag and drop files to here to upload.</span>
            </template>

# Vue Fluid Component

Fluid is a layout component to make descendant components span full width of their container.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Fluid does not require any roles and attributes. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## Basic

Components with the fluid option like InputText have the ability to span the full width of their component. Enabling the fluid for each component individually may be cumbersome so wrap the content with Fluid to instead for an easier alternative. Any component that has the fluid property can be nested inside the Fluid component. The fluid property of a child component has higher precedence than the fluid container as shown in the last sample.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<div>
    <label for="non-fluid" class="font-bold mb-2 block">Non-Fluid</label>
    <InputText id="non-fluid" />
</div>

<div>
    <label for="fluid" class="font-bold mb-2 block">Fluid Prop</label>
    <InputText id="fluid" fluid />
</div>

<Fluid>
    <span class="font-bold mb-2 block">Fluid Container</span>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
        <div><InputText /></div>
        <div><InputText /></div>
        <div class="col-span-full"><InputText /></div>
        <div><InputText :fluid="false" placeholder="Non-Fluid" /></div>
    </div>
</Fluid>
```

# Vue Gallery Component

Galleria is a content gallery component.

## AccessibilityDoc

Screen Reader Galleria uses region role and since any attribute is passed to the main container element, attributes such as aria-label and aria-roledescription can be used as well. The slides container has aria-live attribute set as "polite" if galleria is not in autoplay mode, otherwise "off" would be the value in autoplay. A slide has a group role with an aria-label that refers to the aria.slideNumber property of the locale API. Similarly aria.slide is used as the aria-roledescription of the item. Inactive slides are hidden from the readers with aria-hidden . Next and Previous navigators are button elements with aria-label attributes referring to the aria.prevPageLabel and aria.nextPageLabel properties of the locale API by default respectively, you may still use your own aria roles and attributes as any valid attribute is passed to the button elements implicitly by using nextButtonProps and prevButtonProps . Quick navigation elements and thumnbails follow the tab pattern. They are placed inside an element with a tablist role whereas each item has a tab role with aria-selected and aria-controls attributes. The aria-label attribute of a quick navigation item refers to the aria.pageLabel of the locale API. Current page is marked with aria-current . In full screen mode, modal element uses dialog role with aria-modal enabled. The close button retrieves aria-label from the aria.close property of the locale API. Next/Prev Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus through interactive elements in the carousel. enter Activates navigation. space Activates navigation. Quick Navigation Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus through the active slide link. enter Activates the focused slide link. space Activates the focused slide link. right arrow Moves focus to the next slide link. left arrow Moves focus to the previous slide link. home Moves focus to the first slide link. end Moves focus to the last slide link.

# Vue Listbox Component

Listbox is used to select one or more values from a list of items.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can be provided aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The list element has a listbox role with the aria-multiselectable attribute that sets to true when multiple selection is enabled. Each list item has an option role with aria-selected and aria-disabled as their attributes. If filtering is enabled, filterInputProps can be defined to give aria-* props to the input element. Alternatively filterPlaceholder is usually utilized by the screen readers as well. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option. down arrow Moves focus to the next option. enter Toggles the selected state of the focused option. space Toggles the selected state of the focused option. home Moves focus to the first option. end Moves focus to the last option. shift + down arrow Moves focus to the next option and toggles the selection state. shift + up arrow Moves focus to the previous option and toggles the selection state. shift + space Selects the items between the most recently selected option and the focused option. control + shift + home Selects the focused options and all the options up to the first one. control + shift + end Selects the focused options and all the options down to the last one. control + a Selects all options. pageUp Jumps visual focus to first option. pageDown Jumps visual focus to last option. any printable character Moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed. Filter Input Keyboard Support Key Function down arrow Moves focus to the next option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. left arrow Removes the visual focus from the current option and moves input cursor to one character left. right arrow Removes the visual focus from the current option and moves input cursor to one character right. home Moves input cursor at the end, if not then moves focus to the first option. end Moves input cursor at the beginning, if not then moves focus to the last option. enter Closes the popup and moves focus to the multiselect element. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the multiselect element. tab Moves focus to the next focusable element in the component. If there is none, moves focus to next element in page.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="lb"></span>Options</span>
<Listbox aria-labelledby="lb" />

<Listbox aria-label="City" />
```

## Basic

Listbox is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the optionLabel and optionValue properties respectively. Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no optionLabel and optionValue would be necessary.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Listbox v-model="selectedCity" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" class="w-full md:w-56" />
```

## Checkmark

An alternative way to highlight the selected option is displaying a checkmark instead.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Listbox v-model="selectedCity" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" checkmark :highlightOnSelect="false" class="w-full md:w-56" />
```

# Vue MegaMenu Component

MegaMenu is a navigation component that displays submenus and content in columns.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader MegaMenu component uses the menubar role along with aria-orientation and the value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. Each list item has a menuitem role with aria-label referring to the label of the item and aria-disabled defined if the item is disabled. A submenu within a MegaMenu uses the menu role with an aria-labelledby defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, root menuitems that open a submenu have aria-haspopup and aria-expanded to define the relation between the item and the submenu. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the next focusable item in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the previous focusable item in the page tab sequence. enter If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. space If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. escape If focus is inside a popup submenu, closes the submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu. down arrow If focus is on a root element, open a submenu and moves focus to the first element in the submenu otherwise moves focus to the next menuitem within the submenu. up arrow If focus is on a root element, opens a submenu and moves focus to the last element in the submenu otherwise moves focus to the previous menuitem within the submenu. alt + up arrow If focus is inside a popup menu, moves focus to the first element in the submenu otherwise closes the submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu in horizontal mode. right arrow If focus is on a root element, moves focus to the next menuitem. If the focus in inside a submenu, moves focus to the first menuitem of the next menu group. left arrow If focus is on a root element, moves focus to the previous menuitem. If the focus in inside a submenu, moves focus to the first menuitem of the previous menu group. home Moves focus to the first menuitem within the submenu. end Moves focus to the last menuitem within the submenu. any printable character Moves focus to the menuitem whose label starts with the characters being typed.

## Basic

MegaMenu requires a collection of menuitems as its model .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<MegaMenu :model="items" />
```

## Command

The command property of a menuitem defines the callback to run when an item is activated by click or a key event.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
{
    label: 'Log out',
    icon: 'pi pi-signout',
    command: () => {
        // Callback to run
    }
}
```

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import MegaMenu from 'primevue/megamenu';
```

## Router

Items with navigation are defined with templating to be able to use a router link component, an external link or programmatic navigation.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<MegaMenu :model="items">
    <template #item="{ item }">
        <router-link v-if="item.route" v-slot="{ href, navigate }" :to="item.route" custom>
            <a v-ripple :href="href" @click="navigate">
                <span :class="item.icon" />
                <span class="ml-2">{{ item.label }}</span>
            </a>
        </router-link>
        <a v-else v-ripple :href="item.url" :target="item.target">
            <span :class="item.icon" />
            <span class="ml-2">{{ item.label }}</span>
        </a>
    </template>
</MegaMenu>

# Vue Menu Component

Menu displays a list of items in vertical orientation.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Menu component uses the menu role and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. Each list item has a menuitem role with aria-label referring to the label of the item and aria-disabled defined if the item is disabled. In popup mode, the component implicitly manages the aria-expanded , aria-haspopup and aria-controls attributes of the target element to define the relation between the target and the popup. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the next focusable item in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the previous focusable item in the page tab sequence. enter Activates the focused menuitem. If menu is in overlay mode, popup gets closes and focus moves to target. space Activates the focused menuitem. If menu is in overlay mode, popup gets closes and focus moves to target. escape If menu is in overlay mode, popup gets closes and focus moves to target. down arrow Moves focus to the next menuitem. up arrow Moves focus to the previous menuitem. alt + up arrow If menu is in overlay mode, popup gets closes and focus moves to the target. home Moves focus to the first menuitem. end Moves focus to the last menuitem.

A submenu within a MenuBar uses the menu role with an aria-labelledby defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, menuitems that open a submenu have aria-haspopup , aria-expanded and aria-controls to define the relation between the item and the submenu. In mobile viewports, a menu icon appears with a button role along with aria-haspopup , aria-expanded and aria-controls to manage the relation between the overlay menubar and the button.

## Label

The position of the labels relative to the meters is defined using the labelPosition property. The default orientation of the labels is horizontal, and the vertical alternative is available through the labelOrientation option.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<MeterGroup :value="value" labelPosition="start" labelOrientation="vertical" />
```

# Vue MultiSelect Component

MultiSelect is used to select multiple items from a collection.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The multiselect component has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls attribute that refers to the id of the popup listbox. The popup listbox uses listbox as the role with aria-multiselectable enabled. Each list item has an option role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-disabled attributes. Checkbox component at the header uses a hidden native checkbox element internally that is only visible to screen readers. Value to read is defined with the selectAll and unselectAll keys of the aria property from the locale API. If filtering is enabled, filterInputProps can be defined to give aria-* props to the input element. Close button uses close key of the aria property from the locale API as the aria-label by default, this can be overridden with the closeButtonProps . Closed State Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the multiselect element. space Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. enter Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. down arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. up arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. any printable character Opens the popup and moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed, if there is none then first option receives the focus. Popup Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next focusable element in the popup, if there is none then first focusable element receives the focus. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous focusable element in the popup, if there is none then last focusable element receives the focus. enter Toggles the selection state of the focused option, then moves focus to the multiselect element. space Toggles the selection state of the focused option, then moves focus to the multiselect element. escape Closes the popup, moves focus to the multiselect element. down arrow Moves focus to the next option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. alt + up arrow Selects the focused option and closes the popup, then moves focus to the multiselect element. shift + down arrow Moves focus to the next option and toggles the selection state. shift + up arrow Moves focus to the previous option and toggles the selection state. shift + space Selects the items between the most recently selected option and the focused option. home Moves focus to the first option. end Moves focus to the last option. control + shift + home Selects the focused options and all the options up to the first one. control + shift + end Selects the focused options and all the options down to the last one. control + a Selects all options. pageUp Jumps visual focus to first option. pageDown Jumps visual focus to last option. any printable character Moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed. Toggle All Checkbox Keyboard Support Key Function space Toggles the checked state. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the multiselect element. Filter Input Keyboard Support Key Function down arrow Moves focus to the next option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option, if there is none then visual focus does not change. left arrow Removes the visual focus from the current option and moves input cursor to one character left. right arrow Removes the visual focus from the current option and moves input cursor to one character right. home Moves input cursor at the end, if not then moves focus to the first option. end Moves input cursor at the beginning, if not then moves focus to the last option. enter Closes the popup and moves focus to the multiselect element. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the multiselect element. tab Moves focus to the next focusable element in the popup. If there is none, the focusable option is selected and the overlay is closed then moves focus to next element in page.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="dd1"></span>Options</span>
<MultiSelect aria-labelledby="dd1" />

<MultiSelect aria-label="Options" />
```

## Basic

MultiSelect is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the optionLabel and optionValue properties respectively. Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no optionLabel and optionValue would be necessary.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<MultiSelect v-model="selectedCities" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" filter placeholder="Select Cities"
    :maxSelectedLabels="3" class="w-full md:w-80" />
```

## Chips

Selected values are displayed as a comma separated list by default, setting display as chip displays them as chips.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<MultiSelect v-model="selectedCities" display="chip" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" filter placeholder="Select Cities"
    :maxSelectedLabels="3" class="w-full md:w-80" />
```

## Template

The type property of an OrganizationChartNode is used to map a template to a node. If it is undefined, the default template is used.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<OrganizationChart v-model:selectionKeys="selection" :value="data" collapsible selectionMode="single">
    <template #country="slotProps">
        <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
            <img :alt="slotProps.node.label" src="https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/flag/flag_placeholder.png" :class="\`w-2rem flag flag-\${slotProps.node.data}\`" />
            <div class="mt-4 font-medium text-lg">{{ slotProps.node.label }}</div>
        </div>
    </template>
    <template #default="slotProps">

# Vue Paginator Component

Paginator displays data in paged format and provides navigation between pages.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Paginator is placed inside a nav element to indicate a navigation section. All of the paginator elements can be customized using templating however the default behavious is listed below. First, previous, next and last page navigators elements with aria-label attributes referring to the aria.firstPageLabel , aria.prevPageLabel , aria.nextPageLabel and aria.lastPageLabel properties of the locale API respectively. Page links are also button elements with an aria-label attribute derived from the aria.pageLabel of the locale API. Current page is marked with aria-current set to "page" as well. Current page report uses aria-live="polite" to instruct screen reader about the changes to the pagination state. Rows per page dropdown internally uses a dropdown component, refer to the select documentation for accessibility details. Additionally, the dropdown uses an aria-label from the aria.rowsPerPageLabel property of the locale API. Jump to page input is an input element with an aria-label that refers to the aria.jumpToPageInputLabel property and jump to page dropdown internally uses a dropdown component, with an aria-label that refers to the aria.jumpToPageDropdownLabel property of the locale API. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus through the paginator elements. enter Executes the paginator element action. space Executes the paginator element action. Rows Per Page Dropdown Keyboard Support Refer to the select documentation for more details about keyboard support.

## Basic

Paginator is used as a controlled component with first and rows properties to manage the first index and number of records to display per page. Total number of records need to be with totalRecords property. Default template includes a dropdown to change the rows so rowsPerPageOptions is also necessary for the dropdown options.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Paginator :rows="10" :totalRecords="120" :rowsPerPageOptions="[10, 20, 30]"></Paginator>
```

## Current Page Report

Current page report item in the template displays information about the pagination state. Default value is ({currentPage} of {totalPages}) whereas available placeholders are the following; {currentPage} {totalPages} {rows} {first} {last} {totalRecords}

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Paginator :rows="10" :totalRecords="120" template="FirstPageLink PrevPageLink CurrentPageReport NextPageLink LastPageLink"
    currentPageReportTemplate="Showing {first} to {last} of {totalRecords}" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <Paginator :rows="10" :totalRecords="120" template="FirstPageLink PrevPageLink CurrentPageReport NextPageLink LastPageLink"
            currentPageReportTemplate="Showing {first} to {last} of {totalRecords}" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const first = ref(0);
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Custom Content

There are two templates available named start and end to add custom content to these locations. Both templates get a state object as a slot property to provide the current page, first index and the rows.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Paginator :rows="10" :totalRecords="120" :rowsPerPageOptions="[10, 20, 30]">
    <template #start="slotProps">
        Page: {{ slotProps.state.page }}
        First: {{ slotProps.state.first }}
        Rows: {{ slotProps.state.rows }}
    </template>
    <template #end>
        <Button type="button" icon="pi pi-search" />
    </template>
</Paginator>
```

<details>

            <template #start="slotProps">
                Page: {{ slotProps.state.page }}
                First: {{ slotProps.state.first }}
                Rows: {{ slotProps.state.rows }}
            </template>
            <template #end>
                <Button type="button" icon="pi pi-search" />
            </template>
        </Paginator>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Headless

Headless mode is enabled by defining a container slot that lets you implement entire UI instead of the default elements. The template receives the following data; first last rows page pageCount totalRecords firstPageCallback lastPageCallback prevPageCallback nextPageCallback rowChangeCallback

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Paginator :rows="10" :totalRecords="120">
    <template #container="{ first, last, page, pageCount, prevPageCallback, nextPageCallback, totalRecords }">
        <div class="flex items-center gap-4 border border-primary bg-transparent rounded-full w-full py-1 px-2 justify-between">
            <Button icon="pi pi-chevron-left" rounded variant="text" @click="prevPageCallback" :disabled="page === 0" />
            <div class="text-color font-medium">
                <span class="hidden sm:block">Showing {{ first }} to {{ last }} of {{ totalRecords }}</span>
                <span class="block sm:hidden">Page {{ page + 1 }} of {{ pageCount }}</span>
            </div>
            <Button icon="pi pi-chevron-right" rounded variant="text" @click="nextPageCallback" :disabled="page === pageCount - 1" />
        </div>
    </template>
</Paginator>

    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Paginator from 'primevue/paginator';
```

## Responsive

Paginator elements can be customized per screen size by defining a template per breakpoint. Note that breakpoints are based on max-width setting, if default key is omitted then the default template would be used. Example below has 4 settings; up to 640px, between 641px-960px, between 961px-1300px and larger than 1301px which is the default.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Paginator
    :template="{
        '640px': 'PrevPageLink CurrentPageReport NextPageLink',
        '960px': 'FirstPageLink PrevPageLink CurrentPageReport NextPageLink LastPageLink',
        '1300px': 'FirstPageLink PrevPageLink PageLinks NextPageLink LastPageLink',
        default: 'FirstPageLink PrevPageLink PageLinks NextPageLink LastPageLink JumpToPageDropdown JumpToPageInput'
    }"
    :rows="10"
    :totalRecords="120">
</Paginator>
```

<PickList aria-labelledby="lb" />

<PickList aria-label="City" />
```

## Basic

PickList requires a multidimensional array as its value bound with the v-model directive and a template for its content that gets the option instance and the index via slotProps.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<PickList v-model="products" dataKey="id" breakpoint="1400px">
    <template #option="{ option  }">
        {{ option.name }}
    </template>
</PickList>
```

**Sample Data:**

```json
/* ProductService */
{
    id: '1000',
    code: 'f230fh0g3',
    name: 'Bamboo Watch',
    description: 'Product Description',
    image: '/bamboo-watch.jpg',
    price: 65,
    category: 'Accessories',
    quantity: 24,
    inventoryStatus: 'INSTOCK',
    rating: 5
},
...
```

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import PickList from 'primevue/picklist';
```

## Template

For custom content support define an option template that gets the item instance as a parameter. In addition sourceheader and targetheader slots are provided for further customization.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<PickList v-model="products" dataKey="id" breakpoint="1400px" scrollHeight="20rem">
    <template #option="{ option , selected }">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap p-1 items-center gap-4 w-full">
            <img class="w-12 shrink-0 rounded" :src="'https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/product/' + option.image" :alt="option.name" />
            <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col">
                <span class="font-medium text-sm">{{ option.name }}</span>
                <span :class="['text-sm', { 'text-surface-500 dark:text-surface-400': !selected, 'text-inherit': selected }]">{{ option.category }}</span>
            </div>
            <span class="font-bold">\${{ option.price }}</span>

# Vue Popover Component

Popover is a container component that can overlay other components on page.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Popover component uses dialog role and since any attribute is passed to the root element you may define attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby to describe the popup contents. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup. Popover adds aria-expanded state attribute and aria-controls to the trigger so that the relation between the trigger and the popup is defined. Popover Keyboard Support When the popup gets opened, the first focusable element receives the focus and this can be customized by adding autofocus to an element within the popup. Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the popup. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the popup. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger.

## Basic

Popover is accessed via its ref and visibility is controlled using toggle , show and hide functions with an event of the target.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button type="button" icon="pi pi-share-alt" label="Share" @click="toggle" />

<Popover ref="op">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-[25rem]">
        <div>
            <span class="font-medium block mb-2">Share this document</span>
            <InputGroup>
                <InputText value="https://primevue.org/12323ff26t2g243g423g234gg52hy25XADXAG3" readonly class="w-[25rem]"></InputText>
                <InputGroupAddon>
                    <i class="pi pi-copy"></i>
                </InputGroupAddon>
            </InputGroup>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class="font-medium block mb-2">Invite Member</span>
            <InputGroup>
                <InputText disabled />
                <Button label="Invite" icon="pi pi-users"></Button>
            </InputGroup>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class="font-medium block mb-2">Team Members</span>
            <ul class="list-none p-0 m-0 flex flex-col gap-4">
                <li v-for="member in members" :key="member.name" class="flex items-center gap-2">
                    <img :src="\`https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/avatar/\${member.image}\`" style="width: 32px" />
                    <div>
                        <span class="font-medium">{{ member.name }}</span>
                        <div class="text-sm text-surface-500 dark:text-surface-400">{{ member.email }}</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-surface-500 dark:text-surface-400 ml-auto text-sm">
                        <span>{{ member.role }}</span>
                        <i class="pi pi-angle-down"></i>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</Popover>
```

## DataTable

Place the Popover outside of the data iteration components to avoid rendering it multiple times.

# Vue Select Component

Select is used to choose an item from a collection of options.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The select element has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. If the editable option is enabled aria-autocomplete is also added. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls and aria-activedescendant attribute is used to instruct screen reader which option to read during keyboard navigation within the popup list. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the combobox element and uses listbox as the role. Each list item has an option role, an id to match the aria-activedescendant of the input element along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-disabled attributes. If filtering is enabled, filterInputProps can be defined to give aria-* props to the filter input element. Closed State Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the select element. space Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. enter Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. down arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. up arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then last option receives the focus. any printable character Opens the popup and moves focus to the option whose label starts with the characters being typed, if there is none and select is not editable then first option receives the focus.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="dd1"></span>Options</span>
<select aria-labelledby="dd1" />

<select aria-label="Options" />
```

## Basic

Select is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the optionLabel and optionValue properties respectively. Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no optionLabel and optionValue would be necessary.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Select v-model="selectedCity" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" placeholder="Select a City" class="w-full md:w-56" />
```

## Checkmark

An alternative way to highlight the selected option is displaying a checkmark instead.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Select v-model="selectedCity" :options="cities" optionLabel="name" placeholder="Select a City" checkmark :highlightOnSelect="false" class="w-full md:w-56" />
```

# Vue SelectButton Component

SelectButton is used to choose single or multiple items from a list using buttons.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader SelectButton component uses ToggleButton internally and has group role. Value to describe the component can be provided via aria-labelledby property. Keyboard Support Keyboard interaction is derived from the native browser handling of checkboxs in a group. Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element in the page tab sequence. space Toggles the checked state of a button.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="label_number">Number</span>
<Slider aria-labelledby="label_number" />

<Slider aria-label="Number" />
```

## Basic

SelectButton is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the optionLabel and optionValue properties respectively. Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no optionLabel and optionValue would be necessary.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<SelectButton v-model="value" :options="options" />
```

## Disabled

When disabled is present, the element cannot be edited and focused entirely. Certain options can also be disabled using the optionDisabled property.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<SelectButton v-model="value" :options="options" disabled />
<SelectButton v-model="value" :options="options2" optionDisabled="constant" optionLabel="name" />
```

# Vue Skeleton Component

Skeleton is a placeholder to display instead of the actual content.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Skeleton uses aria-hidden as "true" so that it gets ignored by screen readers, any valid attribute is passed to the root element so you may customize it further if required. If multiple skeletons are grouped inside a container, you may use aria-busy on the container element as well to indicate the loading process. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## Steps Only

Use Stepper with a StepList only for custom requirements where a progress indicator is needed.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Stepper value="1" class="basis-[50rem]">
    <StepList>
        <Step value="1">Design</Step>
        <Step value="2">Development</Step>
        <Step value="3">QA</Step>
    </StepList>
</Stepper>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <Stepper value="1" class="basis-[50rem]">
            <StepList>
                <Step value="1">Design</Step>
                <Step value="2">Development</Step>
                <Step value="3">QA</Step>
            </StepList>
        </Stepper>
    </div>
</template>
```
</details>

## Template

Custom content for a step is defined with the default slot. The optional as property controls the default container element of a step, for example setting it to a button renders a button for the header instead of a div. The asChild option enables the headless mode for further customization by passing callbacks and properties to implement your own step.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Stepper v-model:value="activeStep" class="basis-[40rem]">
    <StepList>
        <Step v-slot="{ activateCallback, value, a11yAttrs }" asChild :value="1">
            <div class="flex flex-row flex-auto gap-2" v-bind="a11yAttrs.root">
                <button class="bg-transparent border-0 inline-flex flex-col gap-2" @click="activateCallback" v-bind="a11yAttrs.header">

                        ]"

## Vertical

Vertical layout requires StepItem as a wrapper of Step and StepPanel components.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Stepper value="1">
    <StepItem value="1">
        <Step>Header I</Step>
        <StepPanel v-slot="{ activateCallback }">
            <div class="flex flex-col h-48">
                <div class="border-2 border-dashed border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded bg-surface-50 dark:bg-surface-950 flex-auto flex justify-center items-center font-medium">Content I</div>
            </div>
             <div class="py-6">
                <Button label="Next" @click="activateCallback('2')" />
            </div>
        </StepPanel>
    </StepItem>
    <StepItem value="2">
        <Step>Header II</Step>
        <StepPanel v-slot="{ activateCallback }">
            <div class="flex flex-col h-48">

# Vue StyleClass Directive

StyleClass manages css classes declaratively to during enter/leave animations or just to toggle classes on an element.

## Animation

Classes to apply during enter and leave animations are specified using the enterFromClass , enterActiveClass , enterToClass , leaveFromClass , leaveActiveClass , leaveToClass properties. In addition in case the target is an overlay, hideOnOutsideClick would be handy to hide the target if outside of the popup is clicked. First example uses a custom fade animation, and second one uses animate-slide from tailwind-primeui plugin.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<div class="card flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <div>
            <Button v-styleclass="{ selector: '.box1', enterFromClass: 'my-hidden', enterActiveClass: 'my-fadein' }" label="FadeIn" class="mr-2" />
            <Button v-styleclass="{ selector: '.box1', leaveActiveClass: 'my-fadeout', leaveToClass: 'my-hidden' }" label="FadeOut" severity="secondary" />
        </div>
        <div class="h-32">
            <div class="my-hidden animate-duration-500 box1">
                <div class="flex bg-primary text-primary-contrast items-center justify-center py-4 rounded-md mt-4 font-bold w-32 h-32">Custom</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <div>
            <Button v-styleclass="{ selector: '.box2', enterFromClass: 'hidden', enterActiveClass: 'animate-slidedown' }" label="SlideDown" class="mr-2" />
            <Button v-styleclass="{ selector: '.box2', leaveActiveClass: 'animate-slideup', leaveToClass: 'hidden' }" label="SlideUp" severity="secondary" />
        </div>
        <div class="h-32">
            <div class="hidden animate-duration-500 box2 overflow-hidden">
                <div class="flex bg-primary text-primary-contrast items-center justify-center py-4 rounded-md mt-4 font-bold w-32 h-32">Content</div>
            </div>

## HideOnResizeDoc

When hideOnResize is enabled, the leave animation is triggered automatically when resizing occurs. Use the resizeSelector property to specify whether to listen to window resize events or element-specific resize events. Set resizeSelector to "window" (default) or "document" for browser resize, or a CSS selector to observe the target element's dimensions.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button
    v-styleclass="{ selector: '.box', hideOnResize: true, enterFromClass: 'hidden', enterActiveClass: 'animate-fadein', leaveActiveClass: 'animate-fadeout', leaveToClass: 'hidden' }"
    label="Show Window Responsive Content"
/>
<div class="box hidden animate-duration-300 border border-lg border-surface">
    <div class="p-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Window Responsive Panel</h3>
        <p class="text-sm">This panel will hide when you resize the browser window.</p>
        <p class="text-sm">Try resizing your browser window to see the effect.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<Button
    v-styleclass="{
        selector: '.resizable',
        resizeSelector: '.resizable',
        hideOnResize: true,
        enterFromClass: 'hidden',
        enterActiveClass: 'animate-fadein',
        leaveActiveClass: 'animate-fadeout',
        leaveToClass: 'hidden'
    }"
    label="Show Resizable Panel"
/>
<div class="resizable hidden animate-duration-300 border border-lg border-surface w-[20rem] w-max-[25rem] w-min-[15rem] overflow-auto resize">
    <div class="p-4 h-full flex flex-col gap-2">

## Dynamic

Tabs can be generated dynamically using the standard v-for directive on Tab and TabPanel.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tabs value="0">
    <TabList>
        <Tab v-for="tab in tabs" :key="tab.title" :value="tab.value">{{ tab.title }}</Tab>
    </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
        <TabPanel v-for="tab in tabs" :key="tab.content" :value="tab.value">
            <p class="m-0">{{ tab.content }}</p>
        </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

                </TabPanel>
            </TabPanels>
        </Tabs>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const tabs = ref([
    { title: 'Tab 1', content: 'Tab 1 Content', value: '0' },
    { title: 'Tab 2', content: 'Tab 2 Content', value: '1' },
    { title: 'Tab 3', content: 'Tab 3 Content', value: '2' }
]);
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Tabs from 'primevue/tabs';
import TabList from 'primevue/tablist';
import Tab from 'primevue/tab';
import TabPanels from 'primevue/tabpanels';
import TabPanel from 'primevue/tabpanel';
```

## Scrollable

Adding scrollable property displays navigational buttons at each side to scroll between tabs.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tabs value="0" scrollable>
    <TabList>
        <Tab v-for="tab in scrollableTabs" :key="tab.title" :value="tab.value">
            {{ tab.title }}
        </Tab>
    </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
        <TabPanel v-for="tab in scrollableTabs" :key="tab.content" :value="tab.value">
            <p class="m-0">{{ tab.content }}</p>
        </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const scrollableTabs = ref(Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => ({ title: \`Tab \${i + 1}\`, content: \`Tab \${i + 1} Content\`, value: \`\${i}\` })));
<\/script>
```

## Tab Menu

A navigation menu is implemented using tabs without the panels where the content of a tab is provided by a route component like router-view . For the purpose of this demo, router-view is not included.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tabs value="/dashboard">
    <TabList>
        <Tab v-for="tab in items" :key="tab.label" :value="tab.route">
            <router-link v-if="tab.route" v-slot="{ href, navigate }" :to="tab.route" custom>
                <a v-ripple :href="href" @click="navigate" class="flex items-center gap-2 text-inherit">
                    <i :class="tab.icon" />
                    <span>{{ tab.label }}</span>
                </a>
            </router-link>
        </Tab>
    </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

                    <router-link v-if="tab.route" v-slot="{ href, navigate }" :to="tab.route" custom>
                        <a v-ripple :href="href" @click="navigate" class="flex items-center gap-2 text-inherit">
                            <i :class="tab.icon" />
                            <span>{{ tab.label }}</span>
                        </a>
                    </router-link>
                </Tab>
            </TabList>
        </Tabs>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const items = ref([
    { route: '/dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: 'pi pi-home' },
    { route: '/transactions', label: 'Transactions', icon: 'pi pi-chart-line' },
    { route: '/products', label: 'Products', icon: 'pi pi-list' },
    { route: '/messages', label: 'Messages', icon: 'pi pi-inbox' }
]);
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Template

Custom content for a tab is defined with the default slot. The optional as property controls the default container element of a tab, for example setting it to a div renders a div for the header instead of a button. The asChild option enables the headless mode for further customization by passing callbacks and properties to implement your own tab header.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tabs value="0">
    <TabList>
        <Tab value="0" as="div" class="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Avatar image="https://primefaces.org/cdn/primevue/images/avatar/amyelsner.png" shape="circle" />
            <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap">Amy Elsner</span>

        </Tab>
        <Tab v-slot="slotProps" value="2" asChild>
            <div :class="['flex items-center gap-2', slotProps.class]" @click="slotProps.onClick" v-bind="slotProps.a11yAttrs">

# Vue TieredMenu Component

TieredMenu displays submenus in nested overlays.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader TieredMenu component uses the menubar role with aria-orientation set to "vertical" and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. Each list item has a menuitem role with aria-label referring to the label of the item and aria-disabled defined if the item is disabled. A submenu within a TieredMenu uses the menu role with an aria-labelledby defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, menuitems that open a submenu have aria-haspopup and aria-expanded to define the relation between the item and the submenu. In popup mode, the component implicitly manages the aria-expanded , aria-haspopup and aria-controls attributes of the target element to define the relation between the target and the popup. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the next focusable item in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the previous focusable item in the page tab sequence. enter If menuitem has a submenu, opens the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. space If menuitem has a submenu, opens the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. escape If focus is inside a popup submenu, closes the submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu. down arrow Moves focus to the next menuitem within the submenu. up arrow Moves focus to the previous menuitem within the submenu. alt + up arrow Closes the popup, then moves focus to the target element. right arrow If option is closed, opens the option otherwise moves focus to the first child option. left arrow If option is open, closes the option otherwise moves focus to the parent option. home Moves focus to the first menuitem within the submenu. end Moves focus to the last menuitem within the submenu. any printable character Moves focus to the menuitem whose label starts with the characters being typed.

## Basic

TieredMenu requires a collection of menuitems as its model .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TieredMenu :model="items" />
```

## Command

The command property defines the callback to run when an item is activated by click or a key event.

**Basic Usage:**

## Router

Items with navigation are defined with templating to be able to use a router link component, an external link or programmatic navigation.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TieredMenu :model="items">
    <template #item="{ item, props, hasSubmenu }">
        <router-link v-if="item.route" v-slot="{ href, navigate }" :to="item.route" custom>
            <a v-ripple :href="href" v-bind="props.action" @click="navigate">
                <span :class="item.icon" />
                <span class="ml-2">{{ item.label }}</span>
            </a>
        </router-link>
        <a v-else v-ripple :href="item.url" :target="item.target" v-bind="props.action">
            <span :class="item.icon" />
            <span class="ml-2">{{ item.label }}</span>
            <span v-if="hasSubmenu" class="pi pi-angle-right ml-auto" />
        </a>

# Vue Timeline Component

Timeline visualizes a series of chained events.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Timeline uses a semantic ordered list element to list the events. No specific role is enforced, still you may use any aria role and attributes as any valid attribute is passed to the list element. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## Alignment

Content location relative the line is defined with the align property.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Timeline :value="events" class="w-full md:w-80">
    <template #content="slotProps">
        {{ slotProps.item.status }}
    </template>
</Timeline>

<Timeline :value="events" align="right" class="w-full md:w-80">
    <template #content="slotProps">
        {{ slotProps.item.status }}
    </template>
</Timeline>

<Timeline :value="events" align="alternate" class="w-full md:w-80">
    <template #content="slotProps">
        {{ slotProps.item.status }}
    </template>
</Timeline>

<Toast position="top-center" group="headless" @close="visible = false">
    <template #container="{ message, closeCallback }">
        <section class="flex flex-col p-4 gap-4 w-full bg-primary/70 rounded-xl">
            <div class="flex items-center gap-5">

                <span class="font-bold text-base text-white dark:text-black">{{ message.summary }}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">

# Vue Toolbar Component

Toolbar is a grouping component for buttons and other content.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Toolbar uses toolbar role to the root element, aria-orientation is not included as it defaults to "horizontal". Any valid attribute is passed to the root element so you may add additional properties like aria-labelledby to define the element if required. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements. Arbitrary content can be placed with templating and elements like buttons inside should follow the page tab sequence.

## Basic

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Toolbar>
    <template #start>
        <Button icon="pi pi-plus" class="mr-2" severity="secondary" text />
        <Button icon="pi pi-print" class="mr-2" severity="secondary" text />
        <Button icon="pi pi-upload" severity="secondary" text />
    </template>

    <template #center>
        <IconField>
            <InputIcon>
                <i class="pi pi-search" />
            </InputIcon>
            <InputText placeholder="Search" />

# Vue Tree Component

Tree is used to display hierarchical data.

## AccessibilityDoc

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The root list element has a tree role whereas each list item has a treeitem role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-expanded attributes. In checkbox selection, aria-checked is used instead of aria-selected . The container element of a treenode has the group role. Checkbox and toggle icons are hidden from screen readers as their parent element with treeitem role and attributes are used instead for readers and keyboard support. The aria-setsize , aria-posinset and aria-level attributes are calculated implicitly and added to each treeitem. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the last selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Selects the focused treenode. space Selects the focused treenode. down arrow Moves focus to the next treenode. up arrow Moves focus to the previous treenode. right arrow If node is closed, opens the node otherwise moves focus to the first child node. left arrow If node is open, closes the node otherwise moves focus to the parent node.

## Basic

Tree component requires an array of TreeNode objects as its value .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tree :value="nodes" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>
```

**Sample Data:**

```json
{
    key: '0',
    label: 'Documents',
    data: 'Documents Folder',
    icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-inbox',
    children: [
        {
            key: '0-0',
            label: 'Work',
            data: 'Work Folder',
            icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog',
            children: [
                { key: '0-0-0', label: 'Expenses.doc', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Expenses Document' },
                { key: '0-0-1', label: 'Resume.doc', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Resume Document' }
            ]
        },
        {
            key: '0-1',
            label: 'Home',
            data: 'Home Folder',
            icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home',
            children: [{ key: '0-1-0', label: 'Invoices.txt', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Invoices for this month' }]
        }
    ]
},
...
```

## Controlled

Tree state can be controlled programmatically with the expandedKeys property that defines the keys that are expanded. This property is a Map instance whose key is the key of a node and value is a boolean. Note that expandedKeys also supports two-way binding with the v-model directive.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mb-6">
    <Button type="button" icon="pi pi-plus" label="Expand All" @click="expandAll" />
    <Button type="button" icon="pi pi-minus" label="Collapse All" @click="collapseAll" />
</div>
<Tree v-model:expandedKeys="expandedKeys" :value="nodes" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>
```

## EventsDoc

An event is provided for each type of user interaction such as expand, collapse and selection.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tree v-model:selectionKeys="selectedKey" :value="nodes" selectionMode="single" :metaKeySelection="false"
    @nodeSelect="onNodeSelect" @nodeUnselect="onNodeUnselect" @nodeExpand="onNodeExpand" @nodeCollapse="onNodeCollapse" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>
```

## FilterDoc

Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property, by default label property of a node is used to compare against the value in the text field, in order to customize which field(s) should be used during search define filterBy property. In addition filterMode specifies the filtering strategy. In lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tree :value="nodes" :filter="true" filterMode="lenient" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>
<Tree :value="nodes" :filter="true" filterMode="strict" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import Tree from 'primevue/tree';
```

## LazyDoc

Lazy loading is useful when dealing with huge datasets, in this example nodes are dynamically loaded on demand using loading property and node-expand method.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Tree :value="nodes" @node-expand="onNodeExpand" loadingMode="icon" class="w-full md:w-[30rem]"></Tree>
```

# Vue TreeSelect Component

TreeSelect is a form component to choose from hierarchical data.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The treeselect element has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls that refers to the id of the popup. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the combobox element and uses tree as the role. Each list item has a treeitem role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-expanded attributes. In checkbox selection, aria-checked is used instead of aria-selected . Checkbox and toggle icons are hidden from screen readers as their parent element with treeitem role and attributes are used instead for readers and keyboard support. The container element of a treenode has the group role. The aria-setsize , aria-posinset and aria-level attributes are calculated implicitly and added to each treeitem. Closed State Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the treeselect element. space Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected treenode, if there is none then first treenode receives the focus. down arrow Opens the popup and moves visual focus to the selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. Popup Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Selects the focused option, closes the popup if selection mode is single. space Selects the focused option, closes the popup if selection mode is single. escape Closes the popup, moves focus to the treeselect element. down arrow Moves focus to the next treenode. up arrow Moves focus to the previous treenode. right arrow If node is closed, opens the node otherwise moves focus to the first child node. left arrow If node is open, closes the node otherwise moves focus to the parent node.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<span id="dd1">Options</span>
<TreeSelect aria-labelledby="dd1" />

<TreeSelect aria-label="Options" />
```

## Basic

TreeSelect is used with the v-model property for two-way value binding along with the options collection. Internally Tree component is used so the options model is based on TreeNode API. In single selection mode, value binding should be the key value of a node.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" :options="nodes" placeholder="Select Item" class="md:w-80 w-full" />
```

**Sample Data:**

```json
{
    key: '0',
    label: 'Documents',
    data: 'Documents Folder',
    icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-inbox',
    children: [
        {
            key: '0-0',
            label: 'Work',
            data: 'Work Folder',
            icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog',

## Checkbox

Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox . In checkbox selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is an object that has checked and partialChecked properties to represent the checked state of a node object to indicate selection.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" :options="nodes" selectionMode="checkbox" placeholder="Select Item" class="md:w-80 w-full" />
```

## Filter

Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property, by default label property of a node is used to compare against the value in the text field, in order to customize which field(s) should be used during search define filterBy property. In addition filterMode specifies the filtering strategy. In lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" filter filterMode="lenient" :options="nodes" placeholder="Select Item" class="md:w-80 w-full" />

**Sample Data:**

```json
{
    key: '0',
    label: 'Documents',
    data: 'Documents Folder',
    icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-inbox',
    children: [
        {
            key: '0-0',
            label: 'Work',
            data: 'Work Folder',
            icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog',
            children: [
                { key: '0-0-0', label: 'Expenses.doc', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Expenses Document' },
                { key: '0-0-1', label: 'Resume.doc', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Resume Document' }
            ]
        },
        {
            key: '0-1',
            label: 'Home',
            data: 'Home Folder',
            icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home',
            children: [{ key: '0-1-0', label: 'Invoices.txt', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file', data: 'Invoices for this month' }]
        }
    ]
},
...
```

## Lazy

Lazy loading is useful when dealing with huge datasets, in this example nodes are dynamically loaded on demand using loading property and node-expand method.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" loadingMode="icon" :options="nodes" @node-expand="onNodeExpand" placeholder="Select Item" class="md:w-80 w-full" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card">
        <TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" loadingMode="icon" :options="nodes" @node-expand="onNodeExpand" placeholder="Select Item" class="md:w-80 w-full" />
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

const nodes = ref(null);
const selectedValue = ref(null);

onMounted(() => {
    nodes.value = initiateNodes();

    setTimeout(() => {
        nodes.value.map((node) => (node.loading = false));
    }, 2000);
});

const onNodeExpand = (node) => {
    if (!node.children) {
        node.loading = true;

        setTimeout(() => {
            let _node = { ...node };

            _node.children = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                _node.children.push({
                    key: node.key + '-' + i,
                    label: 'Lazy ' + node.label + '-' + i
                });
            }

            nodes.value[parseInt(node.key, 10)] = { ..._node, loading: false };
        }, 500);
    }
};

const initiateNodes = () => {
    return [
        {
            key: '0',
            label: 'Node 0',
            leaf: false,
            loading: true
        },
        {
            key: '1',
            label: 'Node 1',
            leaf: false,
            loading: true
        },
        {
            key: '2',
            label: 'Node 2',
            leaf: false,
            loading: true
        }
    ];
};
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Multiple

More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple . By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is not necessary to add to existing selections. When the optional metaKeySelection is present, behavior is changed in a way that selecting a new node requires meta key to be present. Note that in touch enabled devices, TreeSelect always ignores metaKey. In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeSelect v-model="selectedValue" :options="nodes" selectionMode="multiple" display="chip" :maxSelectedLabels="3" placeholder="Select Items" class="md:w-80 w-full" />
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

# Vue TreeTable Component

TreeTable is used to display hierarchical data in tabular format.

## AccessibilityDoc

Screen Reader DataTable uses a treegrid element whose attributes can be extended with the tableProps option. This property allows passing aria roles and attributes like aria-label and aria-describedby to define the table for readers. Default role of the table is table . Header, body and footer elements use rowgroup , rows use row role, header cells have columnheader and body cells use cell roles. Sortable headers utilizer aria-sort attribute either set to "ascending" or "descending". Row elements manage aria-expanded for state along with aria-posinset , aria-setsize and aria-level attribute to define the hierachy. When selection is enabled, aria-selected is set to true on a row. In checkbox mode, TreeTable component uses a hidden native checkbox element. Editable cells use custom templating so you need to manage aria roles and attributes manually if required. Paginator is a standalone component used inside the DataTable, refer to the paginator for more information about the accessibility features. Sortable Headers Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the headers. enter Sorts the column. space Sorts the column. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the last selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Selects the focused treenode. space Selects the focused treenode. down arrow Moves focus to the next treenode. up arrow Moves focus to the previous treenode. right arrow If node is closed, opens the node otherwise moves focus to the first child node. left arrow If node is open, closes the node otherwise moves focus to the parent node. home Moves focus to the first same-level node. end Moves focus to the last same-level node.

## Basic

TreeTable requires a collection of TreeNode instances as a value and Column components as children for the representation. The column with the element to toggle a node should have expander enabled.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeTable :value="nodes" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">

## ColumnToggleDoc

Column visibility based on a condition can be implemented with dynamic columns, in this sample a MultiSelect is used to manage the visible columns.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeTable :value="nodes" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <template #header>
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <MultiSelect :modelValue="selectedColumns" @update:modelValue="onToggle" :options="columns" optionLabel="header" class="w-full sm:w-64" display="chip"/>
        </div>
    </template>
    <Column field="name" header="Name" :expander="true"></Column>
    <Column v-for="col of selectedColumns" :field="col.field" :header="col.header" :key="col.field"></Column>
</TreeTable>
```

## ContextMenuDoc

TreeTable has exclusive integration with ContextMenu using the contextMenu event to open a menu on right click along with contextMenuSelection property and row-contextmenu event to control the selection via the menu.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<ContextMenu ref="cm" :model="menuModel" @hide="selectedNode = null" />
<TreeTable v-model:contextMenuSelection="selectedNode" :value="nodes" contextMenu @row-contextmenu="onRowContextMenu" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column field="name" header="Name" expander style="width: 34%"></Column>

## Controlled

Expansion state is controlled with expandedKeys property. The expandedKeys should be an object whose keys refer to the node key and values represent the expanded state e.g. &#123;'0-0': true&#125; .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<Button @click="toggleApplications" label="Toggle Applications" />
<TreeTable v-model:expandedKeys="expandedKeys" :value="nodes" class="mt-6" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column field="name" header="Name" expander style="width: 34%"></Column>
    <Column field="size" header="Size" style="width: 33%"></Column>
    <Column field="type" header="Type" style="width: 33%"></Column>
</TreeTable>

## FilterDoc

Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property to a Column. The filterMode specifies the filtering strategy, in lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants. A general filled called globalFilter is also provided to search all columns that support filtering.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<SelectButton v-model="filterMode" optionLabel="label" dataKey="label" :options="filterOptions" />
<TreeTable :value="nodes" :filters="filters" :filterMode="filterMode.value">
    <template #header>

                <InputText v-model="filters['global']" placeholder="Global Search" />
            </IconField>
        </div>
    </template>
    <template #empty> No customers found.</template>
    <Column field="name" header="Name" expander style="min-width: 12rem">
        <template #filter>
            <InputText v-model="filters['name']" type="text" placeholder="Filter by name" />
        </template>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import TreeTable from 'primevue/treetable';
import Column from 'primevue/column';
```

## LazyLoadDoc

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets, instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data is loaded by invoking corresponding callbacks everytime paging , sorting and filtering occurs. Sample below imitates lazy loading data from a remote datasource using an in-memory list and timeouts to mimic network connection. Enabling the lazy property and assigning the logical number of rows to totalRecords by doing a projection query are the key elements of the implementation so that paginator displays the UI assuming there are actually records of totalRecords size although in reality they are not present on page, only the records that are displayed on the current page exist. In addition, only the root elements should be loaded, children can be loaded on demand using nodeExpand callback.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<TreeTable :value="nodes" :lazy="true" :paginator="true" :rows="rows" :loading="loading"
    @nodeExpand="onExpand" @page="onPage" :totalRecords="totalRecords" tableStyle="min-width: 50rem">
    <Column field="name" header="Name" expander></Column>
    <Column field="size" header="Size"></Column>
    <Column field="type" header="Type"></Column>
</TreeTable>
```

# Vue Virtual Scroller Component

VirtualScroller is a performant approach to render large amounts of data efficiently.

## Accessibility

Screen Reader VirtualScroller has no specific role is enforced, still you may use any aria role and attributes as any valid attribute is passed to the container element. Keyboard Support Component does not include any built-in interactive elements.

## Basic

VirtualScroller requires items as the data to display, itemSize for the dimensions of an item and item template are required on component. In addition, an initial array is required based on the total number of items to display. Size of the viewport is configured using scrollWidth , scrollHeight properties directly or with CSS width and height styles.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>
```

## Delay

The delay property adds a threshold to wait in milliseconds during scrolling for render optimization.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>

<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" :delay="150" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>

<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" :delay="500" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>

import { ref } from 'vue';

const items = ref(Array.from({ length: 100000 }).map((_, i) => \`Item #\${i}\`));
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Grid

Scrolling can be enabled vertically and horizontally when orientation is set as both . In this mode, itemSize should be an array where first value is the height of an item and second is the width.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="[50, 100]" orientation="both" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">
            <template v-for="(el, index) of item" :key="index">
                <div style="width: 100px">{{ el }}</div>
            </template>
        </div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="[50, 100]" orientation="both" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
            <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
                <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">
                    <template v-for="(el, index) of item" :key="index">
                        <div style="width: 100px">{{ el }}</div>
                    </template>
                </div>
            </template>
        </VirtualScroller>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const items = ref(Array.from({ length: 1000 }).map((_, i) => Array.from({ length: 1000 }).map((_j, j) => \`Item #\${i}_\${j}\`)));
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Horizontal

Setting orientation to horizontal enables scrolling horizontally. In this case, the itemSize should refer to the width of an item.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" orientation="horizontal" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px" :pt="{ content: 'flex flex-row' }">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="width: 50px; writing-mode: vertical-lr;">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" orientation="horizontal" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px" :pt="{ content: 'flex flex-row' }">
            <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
                <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="width: 50px; writing-mode: vertical-lr;">{{ item }}</div>
            </template>
        </VirtualScroller>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const items = ref(Array.from({ length: 100000 }).map((_, i) => \`Item #\${i}\`));
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Import

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
import VirtualScroller from 'primevue/virtualscroller';
```

## Lazy

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets, instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data is loaded on demand. To implement lazy loading, enable the lazy property and implement onLazyLoad callback to return data.

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="lazyItems" :itemSize="50" showLoader :delay="250" :loading="lazyLoading" lazy @lazy-load="onLazyLoad" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex justify-center">
        <VirtualScroller :items="lazyItems" :itemSize="50" showLoader :delay="250" :loading="lazyLoading" lazy @lazy-load="onLazyLoad" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
            <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
                <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
            </template>
        </VirtualScroller>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const lazyItems = ref(Array.from({ length: 10000 }));
const lazyLoading = ref(false);
const loadLazyTimeout = ref();
const onLazyLoad = (event) => {
    lazyLoading.value = true;

    if (loadLazyTimeout.value) {
        clearTimeout(loadLazyTimeout.value);
    }

    //imitate delay of a backend call
    loadLazyTimeout.value = setTimeout(() => {
        const { first, last } = event;
        const _lazyItems = [...lazyItems.value];

        for (let i = first; i < last; i++) {
            _lazyItems[i] = \`Item #\${i}\`;
        }

        lazyItems.value = _lazyItems;
        lazyLoading.value = false;

    }, Math.random() * 1000 + 250);
};
<\/script>
```
</details>

## Loading

Busy state is enabled by adding showLoader property which blocks the UI with a modal by default. Alternatively, loader template can be used to customize items e.g. with Skeleton .

**Basic Usage:**

```vue
<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" showLoader :delay="250" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>

<VirtualScroller :items="items" :itemSize="50" showLoader :delay="250" class="border border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-700 rounded" style="width: 200px; height: 200px">
    <template v-slot:item="{ item, options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">{{ item }}</div>
    </template>
    <template v-slot:loader="{ options }">
        <div :class="['flex items-center p-2', { 'bg-surface-100 dark:bg-surface-700': options.odd }]" style="height: 50px">
            <Skeleton :width="options.even ? '60%' : '50%'" height="1.3rem" />
        </div>
    </template>
</VirtualScroller>
```

<details>
<summary>Composition API Example</summary>

```vue
<template>
    <div class="card flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-8">
        <div>
            <span class="font-bold block mb-2">Modal</span>
