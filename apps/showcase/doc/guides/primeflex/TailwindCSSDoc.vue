            Tailwind CSS in particular is a popular choice, we have even built the <a href="https://tailwind.primevue.org">Tailwind CSS presets</a> spin-off project for the unstyled mode to be able to use the utility classes to style the PrimeVue
            components. During this work, we've realized that the value added by PrimeFlex such as providing the PrimeVue theming as utility classes can be implemented as a Tailwind plugin. As part of PrimeVue v4, a tailwind-primeui plugin has been
            created for the seamless integration, the website templating demos have been migrated from PrimeFlex to Tailwind and a converter tool called <i>pf2tw</i> has been created. In summary, PrimeTek officially suggests Tailwind CSS as the
            replacement for PrimeFlex.
