            Tailwind CSS is perfect fit for the unstyled mode, PrimeTek has initiated a new UI library called
            <a href="https://volt.primevue.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volt</a> based on the unstyled PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS v4. Volt follows the code ownership model where the components are located in the application codebase
            rather than node_modules. All components within Volt are essentially wrapped versions of the unstyled PrimeVue equivalents, with an added layer of theming through Tailwind CSS v4. This approach, along with the templating features, offers
            complete control over the theming and presentation.
