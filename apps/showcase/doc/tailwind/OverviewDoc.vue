            Tailwind CSS is a popular CSS framework based on a utility-first design. The core provides flexible CSS classes with predefined CSS rules to build your own UI elements. For example, instead of an opinionated <i>btn</i> class as in
            Bootstrap, Tailwind offers primitive classes like <i>bg-blue-500</i>, <i>rounded</i> and <i>p-4</i> to apply a button. A set of reusable classes can also be grouped as a Tailwind CSS component and there are even a couple of libraries that
            take this approach to build components specifically for Tailwind.

            Tailwind is an outstanding CSS library, however it lacks a true comprehensive UI suite when combined with Vue.js, this is where PrimeVue comes in by providing a wide range of highly accessible and feature rich UI component library. The
            core of PrimeVue does not depend on Tailwind CSS, instead we provide the necessary integration points such as the primeui tailwind plugin and the presets for the unstyled mode.
