            PrimeVue does not require financial sponsorships from its community; instead, to be backed by a solid financial foundation, optional add-ons are offered. These include a Figma UI Kit, premium application templates, and reusable UI blocks
            called PrimeBlocks. The add-ons are optional and there is no paywall when using PrimeVue.
